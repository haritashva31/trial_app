PIO, Council for Indian School Ce rtificate Examinations Important Dates and time taken: RTI : 29.06.2015 FAO: 20.07.2015 SA : 08.09.2015 Closed Hearing : 18.01.201 7 Decided on : 23 .01.2017 FINAL ORDER Parties Presence: 1. Appellant: Absent. Public authority: Mr. Mohan Chandran, Assistant Sec retary, CISCE and Mr. J.K. Das, Senior Advocate present. FACTS: 2. The appellant filed RTI application seeking scan ned answer sheets of all six subjects attempted by his son Kaushik Kumar Gir i in the CISCE examinations for 2014-15, along with information about whether m oney deposited for rechecking of answer sheets is refundable or not. T he CPIO claimed that CISCE was not ‘public authority’ under the RTI Act. FAA u pheld the order of the CPIO. The appellant approached the Commission. Decision : 3. The Advocate representing the respondent authori ty stated that the rechecking sought was done and the new result was f ound to be the same as earlier and the same was communicated to the appell ant. The appellant further wanted re-evaluation of her results. The CPIO said re-evaluation was not provided under norms of Council for Indian School C ertificate Examinations and Rs. 4000 was the fees prescribed for rechecking of all the papers, which was non-refundable. 4. Regarding the request for copies of answer sheet s, Mr. Mohan Chandran, Assistant Secretary stated that they are not public authority and hence there are under no obligation to share the information. He st ated that two High Court judgments upheld their contention that CISCE was no t a public authority. 5. The CISCE is a regulatory body of thousands of s chools spread over various states and discharging regulatory duties si milar to those of CBSE. The Supreme Court has delivered a landmark judgment in CBSE v Aditya Bandopadhyay & Ors. [2011 (8) SCC 497] finally settling principle on sh aring the answer sheets of the candidates in the interest of protecting the standards of education through transparency. The Commission fail s to understand why CISCE will not follow norms set by Supreme Court in CBSE v Aditya Bandopadhyay & Ors. 6. As per the landmark judgment of the Hon’ble Supr eme Court, the evaluated answer-books of an examinee writing a pub lic examination conducted by statutory bodies like CBSE or any University or Board of Secondary Education, being a `document, manuscript record, an d opinion' fell within the definition of "information" as defined in section 2 (f) of the RTI Act. It held that the provisions of the RTI Act should be interpreted in a manner which would lead towards dissemination of information rather than wi thholding the same; and in view of the right to information, the examining bod ies were bound to provide inspection of evaluated answer books to the examine es. Consequently it directed CBSE to grant inspection of the answer books to the examinees who sought information. As laid down by the Supreme Court: “The provisions of RTI Act should be enforced stric tly and all efforts should be made to bring to light the necessary information under clause (b) of section 4(1) of the Act which relates to securing t ransparency and accountability in the working of public authorities and in discouraging corruption... We, therefore, hold that an examining body does not hold the evaluated answer-books in a fiduciary relationship. Not being information available to an examining body in its fiduciary rel ationship, the exemption under section 8(1)(e) is not available to the exami ning bodies with reference to evaluated answer-books. As no other exemption un der section 8 is available in respect of evaluated answer books, the examining bodies will have to permit inspection sought by the examinees.” 7. The stand of the Council that they will only all ow re-checking of marks according to their policy and they will neither sha re nor re-evaluate is contrary to the transparency norms, Judgment of Supreme Cour t. While every University and Educational Institution provide for access, rec hecking or recounting and re- evaluation of evaluated answersheets, denying them is inequality and not in tune with the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court and also contrary to principles of transparency and accountability as envisaged und er RTI Act. It is not convincing that without sharing evaluated answer-sh eets how can they assure justice to the students, who at times might be help less victims of unreasonable evaluation? Why not students get chance to question the defective or negligent evaluation of a particular answer sheet? It is not proper in the part of this prestigious Council to leave the students remedy-le ss in such situations of injustice. The Council should provide space to stud ents, review the examination system and also access to the answer sheet either b y inspection or sharing a copy. The issue is not whether they are public auth ority but, whether they should be accountable or not? 8. The CISCE being an examining body cannot perpetu ate absolute secrecy around answer sheets when all the educational insti tutions of the entire nation are sharing the answer sheets with the students fol lowing Supreme Court order. This Society has no right or authority over answer- sheets of students. The students cannot be denied of their copyright in the answer sheet. The examining body like CISCE might have IPR right over question paper but they do not have any such right on the answer sheets of the students . 9. The Assistant Secretary who represented the Coun cil submitted that they don’t give answer sheets except only on the directi ons given by the court of law. Thus the courts implemented Aditya Bandopadhyay judgment with reference to this Council on application by some students. Does it mean that the Council will give answer sheets only when students approached th e court of law? It is not proper for the Council to drive their students to t he courts which is both time consuming and expensive to the students/parents and also to the Council. They might have to pay fee to the lawyers and also incur legal expenses. The Commission hopes that the Council realises the need for transparency and adopt itself to the change in norms of examination regula tions and bring in necessary changes to promote transparency and accountability in examination as mandated by Hon’ble Supreme Court and Parliament th rough Right to Information Act. 10. As a registered society performing the regulato ry functions in education and examinations, it has fiduciary responsibility t o protect higher standards of examination and evaluation which is possible only t hrough transparency and accountability. They cannot hang on to their pre-in dependence colonial legacy of secrecy of answer sheets anymore. 11. The Commission directs Mr. Mohan Chandran, Assi stant Secretary of the Council to take this issue before their governing b ody so that they review their policy and provide copies of answer sheets to the s tudents as directed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court and introduce re-evaluation a lso. The Commission also recommends Registrar of Societies to take appropria te steps to bring in transparency and accountability in the Council. The Commission directs the respondent authority to provide certified copies of answer sheets as sought by the appellant, within 15 days from the date of rece ipt of this order. SD (M.

Document: Compendium-2023.pdf
Preface The Right to Information Act, 2005 was promulgated to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority. A thorough knowledge of the provisions of the Act on the part of the Public Information Officers/First Appellate Authorities of the public authorities is key to the successful implementation of the Act. During the course of evolving of the RTI Act, 2005, Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) has issued clarifications on various provisions of the Act. For the convenience of the citizens, a compendium of Office Memorandums (OMs) and Notifications issued by DoPT has been launched online, with topic-wise search facility. I hope that the updated Compendium would further enhance the understanding of the provisions of the Act by both information seekers and information providers. This would go a long way in further strengthening the RTl Act. S. Radha Chauhan Secretary, Department of Personnel and Training New Delhi July, 2023 11/13/ 202 1-IR-I 252 2461/2023/IR-I 0 INDEX 1.

Designation of Central Assistant Public Information Officers (CAPIOs) by the public authorities under Section 5 (2) of the Right to Information Act. 2005. The under signed is directed to say that Section 5 (2) of the Right to Information Act, 2005 provides that every public authority shall designate an officer within 100 days of the enactment of this Act, at each sub-divisional or other sub-district level as a Central Assistant Public Information Officer to receive the applications for information or appeals under this Act for forwarding the same forthwith to the Central Public Information Officer or senior officer specified under sub-section (1) of section 19 or the Central Information Commission, as the case may be. 2. Since a number of public authorities do not have offices located at each sub-divisional level or sub-district level, the matter was taken up with the Department of Posts to provide the services of their Central Assistant Public Information Officers (CAPIOs) to function in that capacity for all public authorities under the Central Government. 3. In this connection Department of Posts require urgently the addresses of the nodal officers/central point in each Ministry/Organisation in need of their services as CAPIOs. The Department of Posts have also indicated that they will be in a position to undertake the work only on behalf of those Ministries who have completed this action and have informed them of the same. Ministries/Departments are, therefore, requested to indicate the details of the Central Public Information Officers designated by them as well as the nodal officers/central point in their Department to receive the RTI mails (application etc. forwarded by the CAPIOs) to the Department of Posts urgently. 4. Ministries/Departments are also requested to bring the above position to the notice of other public authorities coming under the preview of the Ministries/Departments concerned for urgent action by them. p (T.Jacob) Joint Secretary to the Government of India To All Ministries/Departments of the Government of India (Secretaries by name).

The undersigned is directed to say that sub-section (1) of Section 24 of the RTI Act, 2Q05 provides that nothing contained in the Act shall apply to the intelligence and security organizations specified in the Second Schedule or to any information furnished by such organizations to the Government. However, this provision does not exempt these organizations from the purview of the Act in respect of the information pertaining to the allegations of corruption and human rights violations. Thus, the citizens have a right, though limited, to seek information from these organizations. Therefore, it is necessary that these organizations too designate Central Public Information Officers to deal with the RTI applications. 2. The Act does not contain any special provision about the method of supply of information in respect of allegations of corruption by the above referred organizations. It, hovever, provides that information in respect of allegations of violation of human rights shall be given only after the approval of the Central Information Commission. In either case, it is possiblc that the applicant may not receive a decision within the time specified or he may be aggrieved by the decision communicated to him. In such a case, he may like to exercise his right to appeal as provided in section 19 of the Act. 3. Keeping above facts in view, all the organizations specified in the Second Schedule of the RTI Act, 2005 are advised to designate Central Public Information Officers (CPIO) immediately, if it has not been done so far.

The undersigned is directed to say that the sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the Right to Information Act, 2005 mandates all public authorities to designate as many Public Information Officers as necessary to provide information under the Act. The Second Administrative Reforms Commission in its First Report (June 2006) has observed that where a public authority designates more than one Public Information Officer (NO), an applicant is likely to face difficulty in approaching the appropriate Public Information Officer, and the applicants would also face problem in identifying the officer senior in rank to the PlO to whom an appeal under sub-section (1) of Section 19 of the Act can be marie. (For convenience such an officer is termed as the First Appellate Authority). The Commission has, inter-a[ia, recommended that all Ministries! Departments/Agencies/Offices, with more than one P10, should designate a Nodal O±icer with the authority to receive requests for information on behalf of all PIOs. The Commission has also recommended that all the public authorities should designate the First Appellate Authorities. 2.It is, therefore, requested that all public authorities with more than one PlO should create a central point within the organisation where all the RTI applications and the appeals ad&essed to the First Appellate Authorities may be received. An officer should be made responsible to ensure that all the RTT applications/appeals received at the central point are sent to the concerned Public Information Officers/Appellate Authorities, on the same day. For instance, the RTI applications/appeals may be received in the Receipt and Issue Section! Central Registry Section of the Ministry/Department /OrgansiationiAgeney and distributed to the concerned PIOs/Appellate Authorities. The R&I/CR Section may maintain a separate register for the purpose. The Officer-in-Charge/Branch Officer of the Section may ensure that the applications/appeals received are distributed the same day. 14/191 11/13/ 202 1-IR-I 2522461/2023/IR-I 3. Sub-section (8) of Section 7 of the RTI Act provides that where a request for information is rejected, the Public Information Officer shall, inter-alia, communicate to the person making the request the particulars of the Appellate Authority. Thus, the applicant is informed about the particulars of the Appellate Authority when a request for information is rejected. There may be cases where the Public Information Officer does not reject the application, but the applicant does not receive a decision within the time as specified in the Act or he is aggrieved by the decision of the Public Information Officer. In such cases the applicant may like to exercise his right to appeal. But in absence of the particulars of the appellate authority, the applicant may face difficulty in making an appeal. It has, therefore, been decided that all the public authorities shall designate the First Appellate Authorities and publish their particulars alongwith the particulars of the PIOs. 4. All the Ministries/Departments etc. are requested to issue instructions to all concerned to take action accordingly. (K.G.

The Central Information Commission has brought to the notice of this Department that officers of some of the public authorities do not behave properly with the persons who seek information under the Rh Act. The undersigned is directed to say that the responsibility of a public authority and its public information officers (PlO) is not confined to furnish information but also to provide necessary help to the information seeker, wherever necessary. While providing information or rendering help to a person, it is important to be courteous to the information seeker and to respect his dignity. 2. Many organizations/training institutions are conducting training programmes on the Right to Information Act. The public authorities should ensure that their PlOs and other concerned officers are exposed to such training programmes. The public authorities may also organize training programmes at their own level. While imparting such training, the officers should be sensitized about the need of courteous behaviour with the information seekers. 3. The Commission has also expressed concern over the fact that many public authorities have not published relevant information under section 4 of the Act. All the public authorities should ensure that they make suo motu disclosure as provided in the Act without any further delay. It is a statutory requirement, which should not be compromised with. 21- 16/191 11/13/2021-IR-1 2522461/2023/IR-I -:2:- 4.All Ministries/Departments etc. are requested to bring the contents of this OM to the notice of all concerned and ensure compliance thereof.

Sub-section 4(1)(b) of the RTI Act, 2005 lays down the items of information which should be disclosed by Public Authorities on proactive basis. Section 4(2) and section 4(3) prescribe the method of dissemination of this information.

In order to enhance quality and quantity of information disclosed by public authorities on proactive basis, Government issued O.M.s dated 15.04.2013, 21.102014 and 29.06.2015 recommending thereby more items to be disclosed by public authorities on proactive basis and get the proactive disclosure audited. 3. One of the items to be disclosed proactively by the public authorities under Section 4(1 Xb) pertains to the names, designations and other particulars of the Public Information Officers and its updation on yearly basis. It has been observed that in some of the public authorities, there are 18/191 11/13/ 202 1-IR-1 252 2461/2023/IR-1 frequent changes at the level of the Central Pubc Information Otticers (CPlOs) and First Appellate Authorities (FAAs). During updation of the names and designations of the CPtOs I FAAs, the public authorities remove the names and designations of the earlier ones from their website. In the absence of complete details (name and designation etc.) of the CPIO concerned at the relevant time, the Central Information Commission white adjudicating second appeals faces difficulty in proceeding with the matter to afford reasonable opportunity of hearing to CPIO, which delays disposal of the cases. 4.

According to the rules the demand draft/banker's cheque 1PO should be payable to the Accounts Officer of the concerned public authority.

The Undersigned is directed to say that a question is raised from time to time whether a Public Information Officer (PlO) has power to charge fee under Section 7(3) of the RTI Act, 2005 in addition to fee prescribed under Sections 6(1), 7(1) and 7(5) of the Act 2.Section 6(1) of the Act enables the Government to prescribe application fee and sub-sections (1) and (5) of Section 7 to prescribe fee in addition to application fee for supply of information. On the other hand sub-section (3) of Section 7 provides the procedure which a PlO has to follow for realizing the fee prescribed under sub-sections (1) and (5) of the Section Details of fees that can be charged by a public authority under the Central Government are contained in the Right to h,forrnation (Regulation of Fee & Cost) Rules, 2005. The Rules or the Act do not give power to the PlO to charge any fee other than prescribed in the Fee and Cost Rules. Attention in this regard is invited to following extracts from the common order passed by the Central Information Commission in Appeal No. CICIMNAJ200B/0185 (Shri K.K. Kishore Vs. Institute of Company Secretaries of India) and Complaint No.ClCtWBlCl2007/00943 (Shri Subodh Jam Vs. Dy. Commissioner of Police): "The Act under proviso to sub-section (5) of Section 7 also provides that fee prescribed under sub-sections (1) and (5) of Section 7 shall be reasonable and no such fee shall be charged from the persons who are below poverty line as may be determined by the Appropriate Government. The Government has already prescribed fees as deemed reasonable mandated under Sections 7(1) and 7(5) of the Act and in the view of the Commission, there is no provision for any further fee apart from the one already prescribed under Sections 7(1) and 7(5) of the Act". xxx 23/191 11/13/202 i-IR-1 2522461/2023/IR-1 0-:2:- "Thus, there is provision for charging of fee only under Section 6(1) which is the application fee; Section 7(1) which is the fee charged for photocopying etc. and Section 7 (5) which is for getting information in printed or electronic format. But there is no provision for any further fee and if any further fee is being charged by the Public Authorities in addition to what is already prescribed under Section 6(1), 7(1) and 7(5) of the Act, the same would be in contravention of the Right to Information Act. The further fee' mentioned in Section 7(3) only refers to the procedure in availing of the further fee already prescribed under 7(5) of the RTI Act, which is "further" in terms of the basic fee of Rs.1O/- . Section 7(3), therefore, provides for procedure for realizing the fees so prescribed". 3. The Commission, while delivering decision in above cases, recommended to this Department to make rules, for charging fee towards supply of information which may include fee for supply of books, maps, plans, documents, samples, models etc. that are priced and towards postallcourier charges for mailing information, when postal/courier charges are in excess of minimum slab prescribed by the Department of Posts arid for other similar situations. 4. The Right to Information (Regulation of Fee & Cost) Rules, 2005 already provide provisions for chargtng of fee for giving information in diskettes or floppies or in the form of photo copy; for providing samples, models, printed material like books, maps, plans etc; and for inspection of records. The Government have, however, not considered it desirable to charge fee towards expenditure involved in mailing information or overhead expenditure etc. Nevertheless, supply of information in a form which would disproportionately divert the resources of the public authority is taken care of by Section 7(9) of the Act according to which information shall ordinarily be provided in the form in which it is sought but supply of information in a particular form may be refused if supply of information in that form would divert the resources of the public authority disproportionately. 5. Ills hereby clarified that where a Public Information Officer takes a decision to provide information on payment of fee in addition to the application fee, he should determine the quantum of such fee in accordance with the fee prescribed under the Fee arid Cost Rules referred to above and give the details of such fee to The applicant together with the calculation made to arrive at such fee. Since the Act or the Rules do not provide for charging of fee towards postal expenses or cost involved in deployment of man power for supply of information etc., he should not ask the applicant to pay fee on such account. However, wherever supply of information in a particular form would disproportionately divert the resources of the public authority or would be detrimental to the safety or preservation of the records, the PlO may refuse to supply the information in that form. 24/191 11 / 1 3 / 2021-I R- I 2522461/2023 /IR-1 -:3 :- 6.Contents of this OM may be brought to the notice of all concerned.

If the information sought is not voluminous or is not dispersed over a large number of files, computation of the photocopying charges should not be a time consuming task. As soon as the RTI application is received, the holder of the information should decide about how much information to disclose and then calculate the photocopying charges so that the CPIO can immediately wilte to the information seeker demanding such fees. 3.

Sub-sections (4) and (5) of section 5 of the Right to Information Act, 2005 provide that a Public Information Officer (PlO) may seek the assistance of any other officer for proper discharge of his/her duties. The officer, whose assistance is so sought, shall render all assistance to the PlO and shall be treated as a PlO for the purpose of contravention of the provisions of the Act. It has been brought to the notice of this Department that some PIOs, using the above provision of the Act, transfer the RTI applications received by them to other officers and direct them to send information to the applicants as deemed PlO. Thus, they use the above referred provision to designate other officers as PlO. 2. According to the Act, it is the responsibility of the officer who is designated as the PlO by the public authority to provide information to the applicant or reject the application for any reasons specified in Sections 8 and 9 of the Act. The Act enables the PlO to seek assistance of any other officer to enable him to provide information to the information seeker, but it does not give him authority to designate any other officer as PlO and direct him to send reply to the applicant. The import of sub-section (5) of section 5 is that, if the officer whose assistance is sought by the PlO, does not render necessary help to him, the Information Commission may impose penalty on such officer or recommend disciplinary action against him the same way as the Commission may impose penalty on or recommend disciplinary action against the plo. 3.

It has been brought to the notice of this Department that the Central Public Information Officers of some public authorities transfer the applications received under the Right to Information Act, 2005 to the Prime Minister's Office in a routine manner when there is just a mention of the Prime Minister or the Prime Minister's Office in the application. According to sub-section (3) of section 6 of the RTI Act, if an application is received by a public authority seeking an information which is held by another public authority or which is more closely connected with the subject matter relating to another public authority, the public authority receiving the application should transfer the application to the concerned public authority. It may be pointed out here that the Prime Minister's Office has been assigned the work of providing secretariat assistance to the Prime Minister. After a decision is taken in a matter, the Ministry/Department to which the matter concerns takes further action regarding issue of orders etc. Naturally, the information in such cases would be available with the concerned Ministry/Department and not the PMO. The CPIO receiving the application should carefully see the subject matter in the RTI application and transfer it, if need be, to the concerned public authority and not to the PMO simply because the applicant has made a reference to the PM or PMO. 2.All the Ministries/Departments etc. are requested to bring the contents of this OM to the notice of all the Central Public Information Officers - V / (K. 0.

It has been brought to the notice of this Department that requests are made to the public authorities under the Right to Information Act for pieces of information which do n'.)t concern those public authorities. Some times, such an information is sought, a part or no part of which is available with the public authority to which the application is made and remaining or whole of the information concerns another public authority or many other public authorities. A question has arisen as to how to dral with such cases. 2.'Section 6(1) of the RTI Act, 2005 provides that a person who desires to obtain any in formation shall make a request to the public information officer (PlO) of the concerned public authority. Section 6(3) provides that where an application is made to a public authority requesting for any information which is held by another public authority or the subject matter of which is more closely connected with the functions of another public authority, the public authority to which such application is made, shall transfer the application to that other public authority. A careful reading of the provisions of sub-section (1) and sub-section(3) of Section 6, suggests that the Act requires an information seeker to address the application to the PlO of the 'concerned public authority'. However, there may be cases in which a person of o' dinary prudence may believe that the piece of information sought by him/her would t,e available with the public authority to which he/she has addressed the application, 'out is actually held by some another public authority. In such cases, the applicant makes a bonafide mistake of addressing the application to the PlO of a wrong public authority. On the other hand where an applicant addresses the application to the PlO of a public authority, which to a person of ordinary prudence, would not appear to be the concern of that public authority, the applicant does not fulfill his responsibility of addressing the application to the 'concerned public authority'. .2/- 69/19 1 11/13/2021-I R-I 2522461/2023/lR-1 -:2:- 3.Given hereinunder are some situations which may arise in the matter and action reqwred to be taken by the public authorities in such cases: (I)A person makes an application to a public authority for some information which concerns some another public authority. In such a case, the PlO receiving the application should transfer the application to the concerned public authority under intimation to the applicant. However, if the PlO of the public authority is not able to find out as to which public authority is concerned with the information even after making reasonable efforts to find out the concerned public authority, he should inform the applicant that the information is not available with that public authority and that he is not aware of the particulars of the concerned public authority to which the application could be transferred. It would, however, be the responsibility of the PlO, if an appeal is made against his decision, to establish that he made reasonable efforts to find out the particulars of the concerned public authority. (ii) A person makes an application to a public authority for information, only a part of which is available with that public authority and a part of the information concerns some 'another public authority.' In such a case, the PlO should supply the information available with him and a copy of the application should be sent to that another public authority under intimation to the applicant. (iii) A person makes an application to a public authority for information, a part of which is available with that public authority and the rest of the information is scattered with more than one other public authorities. In such a case, the PlO of the public authority receiving the application should give information relating to it and advise the applicant to make separate applications to the concerned public authorities for obtaining information from them. If no part of the information sought, is available with it but is scattered with more than one other public authorities, the PlO should inform the applicant that information is not available with the public authority and that the applicant should make separate applications to the concerned public authorities for obtaining information from them. It may be noted that the Act requires the supply of such information only which already exists and is held by the public authority or held under the control of the public authority. It is beyond the scope of the Act for a public authority to create information. Collection of information, parts of which are available with different public authorities, would amount to creation of information which a public authority under the Act is not required to do. At the same time, since the information is not related to any one particular public authority, it Is not the case where application should be transferred under sub-section (3) of Section 6 of the Act. It is pertinent to note that sub-section (3) refers to 'another public authority' and not 'other public authorities'. Use of singular form in the Act in this regard Is important to note. .3/- (K.G V Director 70/191 11/13/ 202 1-IR-I 2522461 / 2023,'i R- I -:3 (iv)If a person makes an application to a public authority for some information which is the concern of a public authority under any State Government or the Union Territory Administration, the Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) of the public authority receiving the application should inform the applicant that the information may be had from the concerned State GovernrrentfUT Administration.

It need be noted that the sub-section simply means that if the information is sought in the form of photocopy, it shall be provided in the form of photocopy and if it is sought in the form of a floppy, it shall be provided in that form subject to the conditions given in the Act etc. It does not mean that the PlO shall re-shape the information. 2.According to section 2(f) of the Act 'information' means 'any material in any form'. A citizen, under the Act, has a right to get 'material' from a public authority which is held by or under the control of that public authority. The right includes inspection of work, documents, records; taking notes, extracts or certified copies of documents or records; taking certified samples of material; taking information in the form of diskettes, floppies, tapes video cassettes or in any other electronic mode or through printouts where such information is stored in a computer or in any other device. Careful reading of the definition of 'information' and 'right to information' makes it clear that a citizen has a right to get the material, inspect the material, take notes from the material, take extracts or certified copies of the material, take samples of the material, take the material in. the form of diskettes etc. The PlO is required to supply such material to the citizen who seeks it. The Act, however, does not require the Public Information Officer to deduce some conclusion from the 'material' and supply the 'conclusion' so deduced to the applicant.

We have also considered the submissions of both the respondent and the third carty in the case. The entire information sought by the Appellant revolves around the complaints made against an officer of the government and any possible action the authorities might have taken on those complaints. The Appellate Authority was very hght in deciding that this entire class of information was quafied as personal information within the meaning of the provisions of Section 8 (j) of the RTl Act. In this connection, it is very pertinent to cite the decision of the Supreme Court of India in the SLP(C No. 27734 of 2O 2 (Girish A Deshpande vs GIG and others) in which it has held that the performance of an employee/Officer in an organisation is primarily a matter between the employee and the employer and normally those aspects are governed by the service rules which fall under the expression personal information, the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or public interest. On the other hand, the disc!osure of which could cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of that individual.' The Supreme Court further held that such information could be disclosed only if it would serve a larger public interestThe information sought by the Appellant in this case is about some complaints made against a government official and any possible action the authorities might have taken on those complaints. It is, thus, clearly the kind of information which is envisaged in the above Supreme Court order. Therefore, the information is completely exempted from disclosure under the provisions of the ATI Act which both tile CPlO and the Appellate Authority have C:C•'S.1A.2C13OOCC li/i 3/2021 -IR-I rightly died in their respective orders. 5.

Further, it requires the Government to update the guide at regular intervals. Accordingly a Guide on the Act was published online on 28.11.2013 to help all the stake-holders viz, information seekers in getting information, public information officers in dealing with the RTI applications, first appellate authorities in taking cogent decisions on appeals and the public authorities in implementing various provisions of the Act in right earnest. 2.The Public Information Officers/First Appellate Authorities should keep in mind the salient features of the guidelines in supply of information to the information seeker and disposal of first appeal respectively, so that information seekers may not resort to filing of second appeals before the Information Commissions. The relevant salient features of the guidelines are reiterated below for consideration of the Public Information Officers and First Appellate Authorities: Supply of Information by the Public Information Officer 1)The answering Public Information Officer should check whether the information sought or a part thereof is exempt from disclosure under Section 8 or Section 9 of the Act. Request in respect of the part of 1 93/191 94/19 1 11/13/ 202 1-IR-I 2522461/Z0a3/IR-I the application which is so exempt may be rejected and rest of the information should be provided immediately or after receipt of additional fees, as the case may be. 2)Where a request for information is rejected. the Public Information Officer should communicate to the person making the request— (i) the reasons for such rejection; (ii) the period within which an appeal against such rejection may be preferred; and (iii) the particulars of the authority to whom an appeal can be made. 3)If additional fee is required to be paid by the applicant as provided in the Fee and Cost Rules, the Public Information Officer should inform the applicant: (i) the details of further fees required to be paid; (ii) the calculations made to arrive at the amount of fees asked for; (iii) the fact that the applicant has a right to make appeal about the amount of fees so demanded; (iv) the particulars of the authority to whom such an appeal can be made; and (v) the time limit within which the appeal can be made. 4)Though there is no hard and fast rule as to when exactly intimation about additional fees is to be given to the applicant, such intimation should be given soon after receipt of Rh application. Disposal of Appeal by the First Appellate Authority 1) While disposing off first appeals, the first Appellate Authorities should act in a fair and judicious manner. It is very important that the order passed by the first appellate authority should be a detailed and speaking order, giving justification for the decision arrived at. 2) If an appellate authority while deciding an appeal comes to a conclusion that the appellant should be supplied information in 2 2522461/2023/IR-I 11/13/2021-IR-I 95/191 addition to what has been supplied by the Public Information Officer, he may either (1) pass an order direcflng the Public Information Officer to give such informaf ion to the appellant; or (ii) he himself may give information to the appellant. In the first case the appellate authority should ensure that the information ordered by him to be supplied is supplied to the appellant immediately. It would, however, be better if the appellate authority chooses the second course of actiOn and he himself furnishes the information alongwith the order passed by him in the matter.

Sir, I am directed to say that clause (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 26 of the Right to Information Act, 2005 casts a responsibility on the Governments of States to develop and organize educational programmes to advance the understanding of the public about exercise of their right to information. It is a gigantic task which requires involvement of various sections of society. Non- Governmental Organisations are providing various kinds of services to the people and creating awareness amongst them. They come in close contact with the public and may play an important role in disseminating knowledge about the use of the Right to Information Act. You are, therefore requested to involve the Non-Governmental Organisations working in your State to spread awareness about the Act. Yours faithfully, (K.G.

The undersigned is directed to say that the Central Information Commission has brought to the notice of this Department that in some cases. (i) The first Appellate Authorities under the Right to Information Act do not dispose off the appeals within the time frame prescribed by the Act; (ii) The Appellate Authorities do not examine the appeals judiciously and express their agreement with the decision of the Central Public Information Officer mechanically; (iii) The Central Public Information Officers do not comply with the directions of the first Appellate Authority to furnish information to the appellant. 2. Section 19(6) of the RTI Act provides that the first Appellate Authority should dispose off the appeal within thirty days of the receipt of the appeal. In exceptional cases, the appellate authority may take forty five days to dispose off the appeal subject to the condition that he shall record in writing the reasons for delay in deciding the appeal. Therefore, each first appellate authority should ensure that an appeal received by him is disposed off within 30 days of the receipt of the appeal. If, in some exceptional cases, it is not possible to dispose off the appeal within 30 days, its disposal should not take more than 45 days. In such cases, the appellate authority should record, in writing, the reasons for not deciding the appeal within 30 days. 3. Deciding appeals under the RTL Act is a quasi-judicial function. It is, therefore, necessary that the appellate authority should see to it that the justice is not only done but it should also appear to have been done. In order to do so, the order passed by the appellate authority should be a speaking order giving justification for the decision arrived at. 102/191 11/ 13/2021-IR-I 252 2461/2023/IR-I 4. It' an appellate authori.y comes to a conclusion that the appellant should be supplied information in addition to what has been supplied to him by the CPIO. he may either (I) pass an order directing the CPIO to give such information to the appellant; or (ii) he himself may give information to the appellant while disposing off the appeal. In the first case the appellate authority should ensure that the information ordered by him to be supplied is supplied to the appellant immediately. It would, however, be better if the appellate authority chooses the second course of action and he himself furnishes the information alongwith the order passed by him in the matter. 5. The Central In formation Commission has also pointed out that some of the Ministries/Departments have appointed very junior officers as appellate authorities who are not in a position to enforce their orders. The Act provides that the first appellate authority would be an officer senior in rank to the CPIO. Thus, the appellate authority, as per provisions of the Act, would be an officer in a commanding position vis-à-vis the CPIO. Nevertheless, if, in any case, the CPIO does not implement the order passed by the appellate authority and the appellate authority feels that intervention of higher authority is required to get his order implemented, he should bring the matter to the notice of the officer in the public authority competent to take against the CPIO. Such competent officer shall take necessary action so as to ensure implementation of the provisions of the RTI Act. 6.Contents of this OM may be brought to the notice of all concej (KG.

Section 4(2) and Section 4(3) prescribe the method of dissemination of this information. The purpose of suo motu disclosures under Section 4 is to place large amount of information in public domain on a proactive basis to make the functioning of the Public Authorities more transparent and also to reduce the need for filing individual RTI applications. 2. Since the promulgation of the Act in 2005, large amount of information relating to functioning of the government is being put in public domain. However, the quality and quantity of proactive disclosure is not up to the desired level. It was felt that the weak implementation of the Section 4 of the RTl Act is partly due to the fact that certain provisions of this Section have not been fully detailed and, in case of certain other provisions there is need for laying down detailed guidelines. Further there is need to set up a compliance mechanism to ensure that requirements under section 4 of the RTl Act are met. 3. In order to address the above, Government of India constituted a Task Force on suo motu disclosure under the RTI Act, 2005 in May 2011 which included representatives of civil society organizations active in the field of Right to Information, for strengthening compliance with provisions for suo mow or proactive disclosure as given in Section 4 of the RTI Act, 2005. Based on the report of the Task Force, the Government have decided to issue guidelines for suo motu disclosure under section 4 of the RTl Act. 11/13/ 202 1-IR-I 2522461/2023/IR-I 4.Guidelines for Central Government Ministries/Departments are on: i.Suo motu disclosure of more items under Section 4. u.Guidelines for digital publication of proactive disclosure under Section 4. iii.

Compliance mechanism for sue mote disclosure (proactive disclosure) under the RTI Act, 2005. 5.The above guidelines are enclosed. However, it may be kept in mind that proactive disclosure should be done in the local language so that it remains accessible to public. It should be presented in a form that is easily understcod and if technical words are used they should be carefully explained. As provided in section 4, disclosure should be made in as many mediums as feasible and disclosures should be kept up to date. The disclosure of Information may be made keeping in mind the provisions of Section 8 to 11 of the RTI Act. 6.Central Government Ministries/ Departments should undertake sue mou disclosure and ensure compliance based on these guidelines. 7.The enclosed guidelines may be brought to the notice of all fr compliance.

There is need for more clear guidelines for web-based publication of information for disclosure. 2.2The Department of Information Technology has been working on setting of technical standards for government websites and the Department of Administrative Reforms & Public Grievances has published guidelines for websites of Government Departments. These guidelines prescribe the manner in which websites need to be designed and how information should be disclosed. While adhering to the standards of government guidelines as laid down by Department of Information Technology and Department of Administrative Reforms & Public Grievances, the following principles additionally should also be kept in view to ensure that websites' disclosures are complete, easily accessible, technology and platform neutral and in a form which conveys the desired information in an effective and user-friendly manner. a) It should be the endeavor of all public authorities that all entitlements to citizens and all transactions between the citizen and government are gradually made available through computer based interface. The 'Electronic Delivery of Services Bill, 2012' under formulation in Government of India would provide the necessary impetus. b) Websites should contain detailed information from the point of origin to the point of delivery of entitlements/services provided by the Public Authorities to citizens. c) Orders of the public authority should be uploaded on the website immediately after they have been issued. d) Website should contain all the relevant Acts, Rules, forms and other documents which are normally accessed by citizens. 117/191 11/13/2021-IR-I 2522461/2023/JR-I e) Websites should have detaed directory of key contacts, details of officials of the Public Authority. f) It is obligatory under Section 4(1)(b)(xiv) of the RTI Act for every Public Authority to proactively disclose 'details in respect of the information, available to or held by it, reduced in an electronic form'. The website should therefore indicate which digitally held information is made available publicly over the internet and which is not. g) As departments reorganize their systems and processes to enable themselves for electronic service delivery, it is recommended that the requirement of bringing due transparency as provided in the RTI Act is given adequate consideration at the design stage itself. h) To maintain reliability of information and its real time updation, information generation in a digital form should be automatically updated on the basis of key work outputs, like a muster roll and salary slip (NREGA in Andhra Pradesh) or formalization of a government order (Andhra Pradesh). Such an approach will lead to automation of proactive disclosure. i) Information must be presented from a user's perspective, which may require re- arranging it, simplifying it etc. However, original documents in original formats should continue to be made available because these are needed for community monitoring of government's functioning. j) The 'National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy by the Department of Science and Technology is based on the principle that all publicly funded information should be readily available. The policy has been notified in March, 2012 and the schedule should be strictly adhered to. k) Information and data should be presented in open data formats whereby it can be pulled by different Application Protocol Interfaces to be used in different fashions more appropriate to specific contexts and needs. lnformation/ data can, for instance, be presented in powerful visual ways using visualisation techniques. Such visual representation of information/ data can give insights that may remain largely 5 118/19 1 11/13/ 202 1-IR-I 2522461/2023/IR-1 hidden in a textual or tabular presentation of data. In some contexts, pictures and audio/videos recordings etc may be more useful. There have been moves in some parts of the country to video record Gram Sabha meetings. A picture of a NREGA worksite, for instance, may tell much more than words can. All such different media and forms should be used for proactive disclosure. I) Every webpage displaying information or data proactively disclosed under the RTI Act should, on the top right corner, display the mandatory field 'Date last updated (DD/MM/YY)'. 119/19 1 11/13/2021-IR-1 2522461/2023/lR-1 3.0Guidelines for certain clauses of Section 4(1)(b) to make disclosure more effective 3.1The elements of information listed in the variou5 sub-clauses of Section 4(1)(b) mustU be disclosed in an integrated manner. For example, the functions and responsibilities of a public authority cannot be understood in isolation from the powers and functions of its employees, the norms that inform its decision making processes and the rules, instructions and manuals that are used in the discharge of its functions. Description of one element presupposes the existence of another. So every public authority must endeavour to integrate the information mentioned in these sub-clauses while preparing voluntary disclosure materials. 3.2Considering that disclosure in regard to certain sub-clauses have been relatively weak, detailed guidelines for four sub-clauses are given below: 3.3 Guidelines for section 4(1)(b)(iii) - "the procedure followed in the decision-making processes, including channels of supervision and accountability". 3.3.1 All government departments have specific duties and responsibilities under the respective Allocation of Business Rules (AOB) issued by the appropriate Government. The constitutional provisions and statutes each department is required to implement are clearly laid down in the AOB. The manner of disposal of matters assigned to each Department/Ministry is described in the Transaction of Business Rules (TOB). Additionally, every department would have a specific set of schemes and development programmes which they are required to implement directly or through their subordinate offices or other designated agencies. These documents contain the specific operations that every Public Authority is required to undertake in the course of implementing the programme or scheme. Every operation mandated under the AOB read with the TOB would be linked to a specific decision-making chain. All government officers have to follow laid down office procedure manual or the other rules which gives details of how representations, petitions and applications from citizens must be dealt with. Templates, formats, and basic steps of decision-making are briefly explained in such manuals. These descriptions constitute the elements of decision-making processes in general. 120/191 11/13/ 202 1-IR-1 2522461/2023/lR-1 3.3.2 Additionally, in the routine work of governance, government functionaries are 0 required to make decisions in a discretionary manner but broad guiding principles are laid down in some rule or the other. For example, the General Financial Rules lay down procedures for a variety of operations relating to government finances. How sanction must be accorded for incurring expenditure; how losses to government must be reported; how responsibility for losses may be fixed on any government servant; how budgets, demand for grants are prepared and submitted; how public works must be sanctioned and executed; how commodities and services may be procured by a public authority; are all explained in these manuals which are updated from time to time. The challenge is to present a simplified version of the decision-making procedure that is of interest to a common citizen. 3.3.3 In view of the above, the guidelines for detailing the decision making processes are as follows: (a) Every public authority should specifically identify the major outputs! tangible results! services! goods, as applicable, that it is responsible for providing to the public or to whosoever is the client of the public authority. (b) In respect of (a) above, the decision-making chain should be identified in the form of a flow chart explaining the rank/grade of the public functionaries involved in the decision-making process and the specific stages in the decision-making hierarchy. (c) The powers of each officer including powers of supervision over subordinates involved in the chain of decision-making must also be spelt out next to the flow chart or in a simple bullet-pointed format in a text-box. The exceptional circumstances when such standard decision-making processes may be overridden and by whom, should also be explained clearly. Where decentralization of decision-making has occurred in order to grant greater autonomy to public authorities, such procedures must also be clearly explained. (d) This design of presentation should then be extended to cover all statutory and discretionary operations that are part of the public authority's mandate under the AOB read with the TOB. 121/191 11/13/ 202 1-IR-1 2522461/2023/IR-I (e) In the event of a public authority altering an existing decision-making process or adopting an entirely new process, such changes must be explained in simple language in order to enable people to easily understand the changes made. 3.4Guidelines for Section 4(1)(b)(iv) - "the norms set by it for the discharge of its functions". 3.4.1 Primarily, the intention of this clause is that every public authority should proactively disclose the standards by which its performance should be judged. Norms may be qualitative or quantitative in nature, or temporal or statutory norms. In order to ensure compliance with this clause, public authorities would need to disclose norms for major functions that are being performed. 3.4.2 Citizen Charters, which are mandatory, for each central Ministry/Department/Authority, are good examples of vehicles created for laying down norms of performance for major functions and for monitoring achievements against those standards. 3.4.3 Wherever norms have been specified for the discharge of its functions by any statute or government orders, they should be proactively disclosed, particularly linking them with the decision making processes as detailed earlier. All Public Authorities should proactively disclose the following: a) Defining the services and goods that the particular public authority/office provides directly (or indirectly through any other agency/contractor). b) Detailing and describing the processes by which the public can access and/or receive the goods and services that they are entitled to, from the public authority/office along with the forms, if any prescribed, for use by both the applicant and the service providing agency. Links to such forms (online), wherever available, should be given. c) Describing the conditions, criteria and priorities under which a person becomes eligible for the goods and services, and consequently the categories of people who are entitled to receive the goods and services. 122/191 11/13/ 202 1-lR-I 2522461/2023/IR-1 d) Defining the quantitative and tangible parameters, (weight, size, frequency etc,) and timelines, that are applicable to the goods and services that are accessible to the public. e) Defining the qualitative and quantitative outcomes that each public authority/office plans to achieve through the goods and services that it was obligated to provide. f) Laying down individual responsibility for providing the goods and services (who is responsible for delivery/implementation and who is responsible for supervision). 3.5Guidelines for Section 4(1)(b)(xi)- "the budget allocated to each of its agency, indicating the particulars of all plans, proposed expenditures and reports on disbursements made". 3.5.1 The public authorities while disclosing their budgets shall undertake the following: (a) Keeping in view of the technical nature of the government budgets, it is essential that Ministries/Departments prepare simplified versions of their budgets which can be understood easily by general public and place them in public domain. Budgets and their periodic monitoring reports may also be presented in a more user-friendly manner through graphs and tables, etc. (b) Outcome budget being prepared by Ministries/Departments of Government of India should be prominently displayed and be used as a basis to identify physical targets planned during the budgetary period and the actual achievement vis-à-vis those targets. A monthly programme implementation calendar method of reporting being followed in Karnataka is a useful model. (c) Funds released to various autonomous organizations! statutory organizations/ attached offices! Public Sector Enterprises! Societies! NG0s/ Corporations etc. should be put on the website on a quarterly basis and budgets of such authorities may be made accessible through links from the website of the Ministry/Department. If a subsidiary does not have a website then the budgets and expenditure reports of 10 123/19 1 11/13/2021-IR-I 2522461/2023/IR-1 such subsidiary authárity may be uploaded on the vjebsite of the principal Public Authority. (d) Wherever required by law or executive instruction, sector specific allocations and achievements of every department or public authority (where feasible) must be highlighted. For example, budget allocation and target focusing on gender, children, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and religious minorities should be specially highlighted. The sector-wise breakup of these targets and actual outcomes must be given in simplified form to enable the vulnerable segments of society to better understand the budgets of public authorities. 3.6Guidelines for Section 4(1)(b)(xiv) — details in respect of information, available to or held by it, reduced in an electronic form. 3.6.1 On the one hand, this clause serves as a means of proactively disclosing the progress made in computerizing information under Section 4(1)(a) of the RTI Act in a periodic manner. On the other, it provides people with clarity about the kinds of electronic information that, although not held by the public authority, is available to them. For example the stocks of ration available with individual fair price shops may not be held by the District Civil Supplies office, but may be available at a subordinate formation. 3.6.2 Keeping in view the varied levels of computerization of records and documents in public authorities, data about records that have been digitized may be proactively disclosed on the respective websites, excluding those records /files /information that are exempted under Section 8. The data about digitized record may include the name of the record and any categorization or indexing used; the subject matter and any other information that is required to be compiled in relation to a file as prescribed by Manual of Office Procedure (and to be prescribed by MOP for electronic records that is under finalization by DARPG), the division! section/ unit! office where the record is normally held; the person, with designation, responsible for maintaining the record; and the life span of the record, as prescribed in the relevant record retention schedule. 11 124/191 11/13/2021-IR-1 252?461/2023/IR-1 4.0Compliance with Provisions of suo motu (proactive) disclosure under the RTI Act • 4.1Each Ministry/Public Authority shall ensure that these guidelines are fully operationalized within a period of 6 months from the date of their issue. 4.2Proactive disclosure as per these guidelines would require collating a large quantum of information and digitizing it. For this purpose, Ministries/Public Authorities may engage consultants or outsource such work to expeditiously comply with these guidelines. For this purpose, the plan/non-plan funds of that department may be utilized. 4.3The Action Taken Report on the compliance of these guidelines should be sent, along with the URL link, to the DoPT and Central Information Commission soon after the expiry of the initial period of 6 months. 4.4Each Ministry! Public Authority should get its proactive disclosure package audited by third party every year. The audit should cover compliance with the proactive disclosure guidelines as well as adequacy of the items included in the package. The audit should examine whether there are any other types of information which could be proactively disclosed. Such audit should be done annually and should be communicated to the Central Information Commission annually through publication on their own websites. All Public Authorities should proactively disclose the names of the third party auditors on their website. For carrying out third party audit through outside consultants also, Ministries/Public Authorities should utilize their plan/non-plan funds. 4.5The Central Information Commission should examine the third-party audit reports for each Ministry/Public Authority and offer advice/recommendations to the concerned Ministries/ Public Authorities. 4.6Central Information Commission should carry out sample audit of few of the Ministries/ Public Authorities each year with regard to adequacy of items included as well as complianceof the Ministry/Public Authority with these guidelines. 4.7Compliance with the proactive disclosure guidelines, its audit by third party and its communication to the Central Information Commission should be included as RFD target. 12 125/191 11/13/ 202 1-IR-1 2522461/2023/IR-1 5.0Nodal Officer 5.1Each Central Ministry/ Public Authority should appoint a senior officer not below the rank of a Joint Secretary and not below rank of Additional HOD in case of attached offices for ensuring compliance with the proactive disclosure guidelines. The Nodal Officer would iork under the supervision of the Secretary of the Ministry/Department or the HOD of the attached office, as the case may be. Nodal Officers of Ministry/Department and HOD separately should also ensure that the formations below the Ministry/Department/Attached Office also disclose the information as per the proactive disclosure guidelines. 6.0Annual Reports to Parliament/Legislatures 6.1Government has issued directions to all Ministries/Departments to include a chapter on RTl Act in their Annual Reports submitted to the Parliament. Details about compliance with proactive disclosure guidelines should mandatorily be included in the relevant chapter in Annual Report of Ministry/Department. 13 126/191 11/13/2021-IR-1 2522461 / 2 23 / I R- I 1 I 1 No. 1/34/2013-IR Government of India Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions Department of Personnel and Training North Block, New Delhi-i Dated: 29th June 2015 Office Memorandum Subject: Implementation of Suo Motu Disclosure under Section 4 of PT!

The 'Electronic Delivery of Services Bill, 2012' under formulation in Government of India would provide the necessary impetus. b) Vebsites should contain detailed information from the point of origin to the point of delivery of entitlements/services provided by the Public Authorities to citizens. cOrders of the public authority should be uploaded on the website immediately after they have been issued. d) Website should contain all the relevant Acts, Rules, forms and other documents which are normally accessed by citizens. 139/19 1 11 / 1 3 / 2021-I R- I 2522461 / 2023 / I R- I e) Websites should have detailed directory of key contacts, details of officials of the Public Authority. f) It is obligatory under Section 4(l)(b)(xiv) of the RTI Act for every Public Authority to proactively disclose 'details in respect of the information, available to or held by it, reduced in an electronic form'. The website should therefore indicate which digitally held information is made available publicly over the internet and which is not. g) As departments reorganize their systems and processes to enable themselves for electronic service delivery, it is recommended that the requirement of bringing due transparency as provided in the Rh Act is given adequate consideration at the design stage itself. h) To maintain reliability of information and its real time updation, information generation in a digital form should be automatically updated on the basis of key work outputs, like a muster roll and salary slip (REGA in Andhra Pradesh) or formalization of a government order (Andhra Pradesh). Such an approach will lead to automation of proactive disclosure. i) Information must be presented from a user's perspective, which may require re- arranging it, simplifying it etc. However, original documents in original formats should continue to be made available because these are needed for community monitoring of government's functioning. j) The 'National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy' by the Department of Science and Technology is based on the principle that all publicly funded information should be readily available. The policy has been notified in March, 2012 and the schedule should be strictly adhered to. k) Information and data should be presented in open data formats whereby it can be pulled by different Application Protocol Interfaces to be used in different fashions more appropriate to specific contexts and needs. Information! data can, for instance, be presented in powerful visual ways using visualisation techniques. Such visual representation of information! data can give insights that may remain largely 9 2522461 / 2023 / I R- I 11/13/ 202 i-IR-I 140/191 (7 hidden in a textual or tabular presentation of data. In some contexts, pictures and audio/videos recordings etc may be more useful. There have been moves in some parts of the country to video record Gram Sabha meetings. A picture of a NREGA worksite, for instance, may tell much more than words can. All such different media and forms should be used for proactive disclosure. I) Every webpage displaying information or data proactively disclosed under the Rh Act should, on the top right corner, display the mandatory field 'Date last updated (DD/MM/YY)'. 1 11/13/2021-IR-I141/191 2522461 / Zö2 3 / I R- I 3.0Guidelines for certain clauses of Section 4(1)(b) to make disclosure more effective 3.1The elements of information listed in the various sub-clauses of Section 4(1 )(b) must be disclosed in an integrated manner. For example, the functions and responsibilities of a public authority cannot be understood in isolation from the powers and functions of its employees, the norms that inform its decision making processes and the rules, instructions and manuals that are used in the discharge of its functions. Description of one element presupposes the existence of another. So every public authority must endeavour to integrate the information mentioned in these sub-clauses while preparing voluntary disclosure materials. 3.2Considering that disclosure in regard to certain sub-clauses have been relatively weak, detailed guidelines for four sub-clauses are given below: 33 Guidelines for section 4(1)(b)(iii) - "the procedure followed in the decision-making processes, including channels of supervision and accountability". 3.3.1All government departments have specific duties and responsibilities under the respective Allocation of Business Rules (AOB) issued by the appropriate Government. The constitutional provisions and statutes each department is required to implement are clearly laid down in the AOB. The manner of disposal of matters assigned to each Department/Ministry is described in the Transaction of Business Rules (TOB). Additionally, every department would have a specific set of schemes and development programmes which they are required to implement directly or through their subordinate offices or other designated agencies. These documents contain the specific operations that every Public Authority is required to undertake in the course of implementing the programme or scheme. Every operation mandated under the AOB read with the TOB would be linked to a specific decision-making chain. All government officers have to follow laid down office procedure manual or the other rules which gives details of how representations, petitions and applications from citizens must be dealt with. Templates, formats, and basic steps of decision- making are briefly explained in such manuals. These descriptions constitute the elements of decision-making processes in general. 142/191 11/13/2021-IR-I 2522461/2023/IR-I 332Additionally, in the routine work of governance, government functionaries are required to make decisions in a discretionary manner but broad guiding principles are laid down in some rule or the other. For example, the General Financial Rules lay down procedures for a variety of operations relating to government finances. How sanction must be accorded for incurring expenditure; how losses to government must be reported; how responsibility for losses may be fixed on any government servant; how budgets, demand for grants are prepared and submitted; how public works must be sanctioned and executed; how commodities and services may be procured by a public authority; are all explained in these manuals which are updated from time to time. The challenge is to present a simplified version of the decision-making procedure that is of interest to a common citizen. 333In view of the above, the guidelines for detailing the decision making processes are as follows: (a) Every public authority should specifically identify the major outputs/ tangible results! services! goods, as applicable, that it is responsible for providing to the public or to whosoever is the client of the public authority. (b) In respect of (a) above, the decision-making chain should be identified in the form of a flow chart explaining the rank/grade of the public ftinctionaries involved in the decision-making process and the specific stages in the decision-making hierarchy. (c) The powers of each officer including powers of supervision over subordinates involved in the chain of decision-making must also be spelt out next to the flow chart or in a simple bullet-pointed format in a.text-box. The exceptional circumstances when such standard decision-making processes may be overridden and by whom, should also be explained clearly. Where decentralization of decision-making has occurred in order to grant greater autonomy to public authorities, such procedures must also be clearly explained. (d) This design of presentation should then be extended to cover all statutory and discretionary operations that are part of the public authority's mandate under the AOB read with the TOB. II Cl 11/13/2021-I R-I143/19 1 2522461/2023/IR-I (e) In the event of a public authority altering an existing decision-making process or adopting an entirely new process, such changes must be explained in simple language in order to enable people to easily understand the changes made. 3.4Guidelines for Section 4(1)(b)(iv) - "the norms set by it for the discharge of its functions". 3.4.1Primarily, the intention of this clause is that every public authority should proactively disclose the standards by which its performance should be judged. Norms may be qualitative or quantitative in nature, or temporal or statutory norms. In order to ensure compliance with this clause, public authorities would need to disclose norms for major functions that are being performed. 3.42 Citizen Charters, which are mandatory, for each central Ministry/Department/Authority, are good examples of vehicles created for laying down norms of performance for major functions and for monitoring achievements against those standards. 3.43Wherever norms have been specified for the discharge of its functions by any statute or government orders, they should be proactively disclosed, particularly linking them with the decision making processes as detailed earlier. All Public Authorities should proactively disclose the following: a) Defining the services and goods that the particular public authority/office provides directly (or indirectly through any other agency/contractor). b) Detailing and describing the processes by which the public can access and/or receive the goods and services that they are entitled to, from the public authority/office along with the forms, if any prescribed, for use by both the applicant and the service providing agency. Links to such forms (online), wherever available, should be given. c) Describing the conditions, criteria and priorities under which a person becomes eligible for the goods and services, and consequently the categories of people who are entitled to receive the goods and services. 2522463 / 2023 / I R-I 11/13/2021-IR-I 144/19 1 d) Defining the quantitative and tangible parameters, (weight, size, frequency etc,) and timelines, that are applicable to the goods and services that are accessible to the public. e) Defining the qualitative and quantitative outcomes that each public authority/office plans to achieve through the goods and services that it was obligated to provide. f Laying down individual responsibility for providing the goods and services (who is responsible for delivery/implementation and who is responsible forsupervision). 33Guidelines for Section 4(1)(b)(xi)- "the budget allocated to each of its agency, indicating the particulars of all plans, proposed expenditures and reports on disbursements made". 35.1The public authorities while disclosing their budgets shall undertake the following: (a) Keeping in view of the technical nature of the government budgets, it is essential that Ministries/Departments prepare simplified versions of their budgets which can be understood easily by general public and place them in public domain. Budgets and their periodic monitoring reports may also be presented in a more user-friendly manner through graphs and tables, etc. (b) Outcome budget being prepared by Ministries/Departments of Government of India should be prominently displayed and be used as a basis to identi' physical targets planned during the budgetary period and the actual achievement vis-à-vis those targets. A monthly programme implementation calendar method of reporting being followed in Karnataka is a useful model. (c) Funds released to various autonomous organizations! statutory organizations/ attached offices/ Public Sector Enterprises/ Societies/ NGOs/ Corporations etc. should be put on the website on a quarterly basis and budgets of such authorities may be made accessible through links from the website of the Ministry/Department. If a subsidiary does not have a website then the budgets and expenditure reports of /3 7 0 (_) 0 2522461 / 2o2' I R- I 11/13/2021-IR -I 145/191 such subsidiary authority may be uploaded on the website of the principal Public Authority. (d) Wherever required by law or executive instruction, sector specific allocations and achievements of every department or public authority (where feasible) must be highlighted. For example, budget allocation and target focusing on gender, children, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and religious minorities should be specially highlighted. The sector-wise breakup of these targets and actual outcomes must be given in simplified fonn to enable the vulnerable segments of society to better understand the budgets of public authorities. 3.6Guidelines for Section 4(1)(b)(xiv) — details in respect of information, available to or held by it, reduced in an electronic form. 36.1On the one hand, this clause serves as a means of proactively disclosing the progress made in computerizing information under Section 4(l)(a) of the RTI Act in a periodic manner. On the other, it provides people with clarity about the kinds of electronic information that, although not held by the public authority, is available to them, For example the stocks of ration available with individual fair price shops may not be held by the District Civil Supplies office, but may be available at a subordinate formation. 3.62Keeping in view the varied levels of computerization of records and documents in public authorities, data about records that have been digitized may be proactively disclosed on the respective websites, excluding those records /files /informatiori that are exempted under Section 8. The data about digitized record may include the name of the record and any categorization or indexing used; the subject matter and any other information that is required to be compiled in relation to a file as prescribed by Manual of Office Procedure (and to be prescribed by MOP for electronic records that is under finalization by DARPG), the division! section! unit/ office where the record is normally held; the person, with designation, responsible for maintaining the record; and the life span of the record, as prescribed in the relevant record retention schedule. 146/19 1 11/13/ 202 i -IR-I 2522461/2023/IR-! 4.0Complia 11CC w itli 1'l'ONiUliS of vim i/win (pr0a:ti\ ej disclosure under the RTI Act 4.1Each M in istrv/Publ ic Authorit shall eusare that these guidelines are t'ul lv operational ized with in a period of' 6 months from the dat 0! their iSSLIC. 4.2Proactive disclosure as per these guide! nes v on Id require cot lating a large quantLim of in formation and dicitizing h.

Clause G) of sub-section (1) of section 8 of the Rfl Act provides that there is no obligation to give any citizen an information which relates to personal information and disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of the individual unless the Public Information Officer or the Appellate Authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information. An ACR contains information about the character, capability and other attributes of the official reported upon, disclosure of which to any other person amounts to cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual. Besides, an ACR, as its name suggests, is a confidential document. The Official Secrets Act, 1923 is not completely superseded by the Right to Information Act.. Sub-section (2) of Section 8 of the 2005 Act gives a discretion to the public authority to disclose or not to disclose the ACRs of an officer to himse'f or to any other applicant. 3. It is clear from the 2h0ve discussion that the public authority is not under obligation to disclose ACRs of any employee to the employee himself or to any other person inasmuch as disclosure of ACRs is protected by clause (j) of sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the Rfl Act, and an ACR is a confidential document, disclosure of which is protected by the Official Secrets Act, 1923. However, the public authority has a discretion to disclose the Annual Confidential Reports of an employee to the employee himself or to any other person, if the public authority is satisfied that the public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests. If it is felt that public interest in disclosure of ACR of any employee outweighs the protected 156/191 11/13/2021-IR-I 2522461/2023/IR-I interests. decision to disclose the ACRs should be taken with the approval of the competent authority. Competent authority in the matter may be decided by the concerned public authority. (K.G. Verma) Director Tel. No. 23092158 To 1. All the Ministries /Departments of the Government of India 2.

Attention is invited to sub-section (3) of section 8 of the Right to Information Act, 2005 (Act) which provides that subject to the provisions of clauses (a), (c) and (i) of sub-section (1), any information relating to any occurrence, event or matter which has taken place, occurred or happened twenty years before the date on which any request is made under Section 6 shall he provided to any person making a request under that section'. References have been received in this Department seeking clarification whether the above provision of the Act requires all the records to be preserved for more than a period of 20 years. The Second Administrative Reforms Commission, in its First Report titled the 'Right To Information — Master Key to Good Governance', has also expressed an apprehension about interpretation of the above provision with reference to the retention schedule of the files. 2.The RYI Act does not prescribe a record retention schedule. The records are to be retained by a public authority as per the record retention schedule applicable to that public authority. It is, however, important to note that weeding out of a file or any other record does not necessarily result into desmiction of all the information contained in that file or record. It is possible that information generated in a file may be available in the form of' an OM or a letter or in any other form even after the file has been weeded out. The above referred provision of the Act requires furnishing of information so available after the lapse of 20 years even if such information was exempt from disclosure under sub-section (1) of Section 8. It means that the information which, in normal course, is exempt from disclosure under sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the Act, would cease to be exempted if 20 years have lapsed after occurrence of the incident to which the information relates. However, the following types of information would continue to be exempt and there would be no obligation, even after lapse of 20 years, to give any citizen - (i)Information disclosure of which would prejudicially affect the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security, strategic, scientific or economic interest of the State, relation with foreign slate or lead to incitement of an offence; sirs faithfully, (K.G.

The undersigned is directed to say that the Government, in a number of cases makes inter departmental consultations. In the process, a public authority may send some confidential papers to another public authority. A question has arisen whether the recipient public authority cart disclose such confidential papers under the Rh Act, 2005. If yes, what procedure is required to be followed for doing so. 2. Section Ii of the Act provides the procedure of disclosure of 'third party' information, According to it, if a Public Information Officer (PLO) intends to disclose an information supplied by a third party which the third party has treated as confidential, the PlO, before taking a decision to disclose the information shall invite the third party to make submission in the matter. The third party has a right to make an appeal to the Departmental Appellate Authority against the decision of the PlO aid if not satisfied with the decision of the Departmental Appellate Authority, a second appeal to the concerned Information Commission. The PlO cannot disclose such information unless the procedure prescribed in section 11 is completed. 3. As defined in clause (n) of Section 2 of the Act, 'third party' includes a public authority. Reading of the definition of the term, 'third party' and Section 11 together makes it clear that if a public authority 'X' receives some 11/13/2021-1 R-1 25U461/2023/IR-I information from another public authority Y' which that public authoi -iiv has treated as confidential, then X' cannot disclose the information without consulting Y, the third party in respect of the information and without following the procedure pkescribed in Section 11 of the Act. It is a statutory requirement, nori-coinpliance of which may make the P10 liable to action. 4.The Public Information Officers and the First Appellate Authorities should keep these provisions of the Act in view while taking decision 1 about disclosure of third party information in general and disclosure of the third party ut formation, when third party is a public authority, in particular. 161/191 5.Hindi version will follow.

On behalf of the Respondent, Shri M.P. Sajeevan, DS & CPIO was present. The third party, Shri S B Agnihotri, DO (DEF: ACQ) MoD was present. Chief Information Commissioner Shri Satyananda Mishra 2. We heard the submissions of both the respondent and the third party in the case. 3. In his RTI application, the Appellant had sought the copies of the complaints made against the third party in the case and the details of the action taken including the copies of the enquiry reports. He had also wanted the copies of the correspondence made between the Cabinet Secretariat and the Ministry of Shipping in respect of the third party in the case. The CPIO after consuFting the third party under Section 11 of the Right to Information Act, had CIC/SM/N20 13/000053 164/191 11/13/ 202 1 -IR-I refused to disclose any such information by claiming that it was personal in nature and thus exempted under the provisions of section 8(1) (j) of the Right to Informatinn (RTl) Act Not satisfied with this decision of the CPIO, the Appellant had preferred an appeal. The Appellate Authority had disposed of the appeal in a speaking order in which ho had endosod the decison o the CFhi'•. 25 4.We have carefully gone through the contents of the RTI application and the order of the Appellate Authority. We have also considered the submissions -1 of both the respondent and the third party in the case. The entire information sought by the Appellant revolves around the complaints made against an officer of the government and any possible action the authorities might have taken on those complaints. The Appellate Authority was very right in deciding that this entire class of information was qualified as personal informahon witIn the meaning of the provisions of Section 8 (i) (j) of the All Act. In this connection, it is very pertinent to cite the decision of the Supreme Court of India in the'SLP(C) No. 27734 of 2012 (Girish P Deshpando vs dO and others) in which it has held that the performance of an employee/Officer in an organisation is primarily a matter between the employee and the employer and normally those aspects are governed by tho service rules which fall under the expression personal information, the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or public interest. On the other hand, the disclosure of which could cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of that individual." The Supreme Court further hold that such information could be disclosed only if it would serve a larger public interestThe information sought by the Appellant in this case is about some complaints made against a government official and any possible action the authorities might have taken on those complaints. It is. thus.clearly the kind of information which is envisaged in the above Supreme Court order. Therefore, the information is completely exempted from disclosure under the provisions of the RTL Act which both the OPIC and the Appellate Authonty have CICISM/A/201 3/000058 165/191 11/13/2021-HR-I -- rightly cited in their respective oners. 5.

Mr. Asish Kumar Roy, Ms. Gargi Mukherjee For the respondents. The petitioner is appearing in person. The writ petitioner claiming to be an activist in the field of right to information, has approached us by filing the present writ petition with the prayer, the authority should not insist upon the detailed address of the applicant as and when any application is made under the Right to Information Act. He apprehends, the interested parties would cause a threat to the activist and in fact there had been past incidents of unnatural deaths of activist in the field, presumably by the interested persons having vested interest to conceal the information that is asked for by the activist. The petitioner submits, the authority may not insist upon the detailed address particularly when the applicant would provide a particular post box number that would automatically conceal their identity to the public at large. We have considered the relevant provisions of the statute. Section 6(2) of the Right to Information Act, 2005 would clearly provide, an applicant making request for information shall not be required to give any reason for requesting the information or any other personal details except those that may be necessary for contacting him. Looking to the said provision, we find logic in the submission of the petitioner. When the legislature thought it fit, the applicant need not disclose any personal detail, the authority should not insist upon his 168/19 1 11/13/ 202 i -IR- 2522461/2023/IR-I 2 detailed whereabouts particularly when post box number is provided for that would establish contact with him and the authority. In case, the authority would find any difficulty with the post box number, they may insist upon personal details. However, in such case, it would be the solemn duty of the authority to hide such information and particularly from their website so that people at large would not know of the details. We thus dispose of this writ petition by making the observations as above. The Secretary, Ministry of Personnel should circulate the copy of this order to all concerned so that the authority can take appropriate measure to hide information with regard to personal details of the activist to avoid any harassment by the persons having vested interest. The writ petition is disposed of without any order as to costs. Urgent certified copy of this order, if applied for, be given to the parties, on priority basis.

Vs. Aditya Bandopadhyay & Ors. The undersigned is directed to invite attention to this Department's O.M. No.1/4/2009-IR dated 05.10.2009 whereby a Guide on the Right to Information Act, 2005 was circulated. Para 10 of Part I of the Guide, inter alia, stated that 'only such information can be supplied under the Act which already exists and is held by the public authority or held under the control of the public authority. The Public Information Officer is not supposed to create information; or to interpret information; or to solve the problems raised by the applicants, or to furnish replies to hypothetical questions.' The same issue has been elaborated by the Supreme Court in the matter of Central Board of Secondary Education & Anr. Vs. Aditya Bandopadhyay & Ors. (Civil Appeal No.6454 of 2011) as follows: "At this juncture, it is necessary to clear some misconceptions about the RTI Act. The Rh Act provldes access to all information that is available and existing. This is clear from a combined reading of section 3 and the definitions of 'information' and 'right to information' under clauses (f) and (j) of section 2 of the Act. If a public authority has any information in the form of data or analysed data, or abstracts, or statistics, an applicant may access such informatiofi, subject to the exemptions in Section 8 of the Act. But where the information sought is not a part of the record of a public authority, and where such information is not required to be maintained under any law or the rules or regulations of the public authority, the Act does not cast an obligation upon the public authority, to collect or collate such non available information and then furnish it to an applicant. A public authority is also not required to furnish information which require drawing of inferences and/or making of assumptions. It is also not required to provide 'advice' or 'opinion' to an applicant, nor required to obtain and furnish any 'opinion' or adiice' to an ipoiicant. The reference to 'opinion' or 'advice' in the definition of 'information' in section 2(f) of the Act, only refers to such material available in the records of the public a ithor.ity. Many public authorities have, as a public relation exercise, provide advice, guidance and opinion to the citizens. But that is purely voluntary and should not be confused with any obligation under the RTI Act." 3.This may be brought to the notice of all concerned. (K.G.

First Appellate Authority Ordered: The first appellate authority on 01/09/2008 ordered "Since the information sought by you does not help the office in its day to day functioning therefore it would put unnecessary burden on the resources. The request is rejected under Section 7(9) of the RTI Act, 2005. However, the information seeker being a resident within 1 km. of this office can visit the section under prior intimation on any working day during office hours to go through the records herself. With the above observations, the appeal is disposed off". Relevant facts emerging during hearing: The following were present. Appellant: Mrs. Shema Respondent: Mr. Wajid Ali PIO The denial of information on the basis of Section 11 and Section 7 (9) of the Act was without any basis in law. Denial of information can only be under Section 8 (1) or Section 9. Section 11 sets out a procedure for giving the opportunity to a third party to give his objections and Section 7 (9) can be invoked only to state that information in the format demanded by the appellant is not possible. However the PIO would have to offer the information in an alternate format when invoking Section 7 (9). Besides the queries do not lend themselves at all to using Section 11 or Section 7 (9). The PIO is directed to give the information to the appellant. He is also warned that denying information in this casual manner will invoke the penal provisions of Section 20 of the Act. Decision: The Appeal is allowed. The PIO will provide the the information to the appellant before 25 January 2009. This decision is announced in open chamber. Notice of this decision be given free of cost to the parties.

Relevant Facts emerging during Hearing held on May 23, 2011: The following were present: Appellant: Mr. Sujit Kumar Mazumder, Advocate on video conference from NIC- Andman Studio; Respondent: Mr. S. R. Mazumder, PIO & Superintendent of Police on video conference from NIC- Kolkata Studio. Based on perusal of papers and the submissions of the Appellant, the Commission noted that information on queries (d), (f) and (g) appears to have been provided by the PIO, CBI (Kolkata). However, he has refused to provide information on queries (b), (c) and (e) on the basis of Sections 8(1)(g) and (h) of the RTI Act. The PIO, CBI (Port Blair) has refused to provide information on query (a) claiming Section 8(1) (g) of the RTI Act. The Commission further noted that vide letter dated 16/11/2010, the PIO, CBI (New Delhi) has refused to provide information on queries (h) and (i) on the basis of Section 8(1)(g) and (j) of the RTI Act. The PIO, CBI (New Delhi) has relied on the decision of the Commission in P. Thavasiraj v. Dept. of Atomic Energy dated 02/09/2008. The Appellant has relied on the decisions of the Commission in CIC/WB/A/2007/01366 dated 31/10/2007, CIC/WB/A/2007/01370-71 and 1492 dated 06/11/2007- dated 04/03/2009. The order was reserved during the hearing held on 23/05/2011. Decision announced on 13 July 2011: The PIO, CBI (Kolkata) has refused to provide information on queries (b), (c) and (e) on the basis of inter alia Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act. Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act provides as follows: "8. Exemption from disclosure of information.- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen,- ...Mr. Sujit Kumar Mazumder Advocate vs Cbi on 13 July, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1077181/ 3(h) information which would impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders;" Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act exempts disclosure of information which would impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders. Merely because the process of investigation or prosecution of offenders is continuing, the bar stipulated under Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act is not attracted; it must be clearly established by the PIO that disclosure of the information would impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders. Ravindra Bhat, J. of the High Court of Delhi in Bhagat Singh v. CIC W.P. (C) No. 3114/2007 has observed as follows: "13. Access to information, under Section 3 of the Act, is the rule and exemptions under Section 8, the exception. Section 8 being a restriction on this fundamental right, must therefore is to be strictly construed. It should not be interpreted in manner as to shadow the very right itself. Under Section 8, exemption from releasing information is granted if it would impede the process of investigation or the prosecution of the offenders. It is apparent that the mere existence of an investigation process cannot be a ground for refusal of the information; the authority withholding information must show satisfactory reasons as to why the release of such information would hamper the investigation process. Such reasons should be germane, and the opinion of the process being hampered should be reasonable and based on some material. Sans this consideration, Section 8(1)(h) and other such provisions would become the haven for dodging demands for information. 14. A rights based enactment is akin to a welfare measure, like the Act, should receive a liberal interpretation. The contextual background and history of the Act is such that the exemptions, outlined in Section 8, relieving the authorities from the obligation to provide information, constitute restrictions on the exercise of the rights provided by it. Therefore, such exemption provisions have to be construed in their terms; there is some authority supporting this view (See Nathi Devi v. Radha Devi Gupta 2005 (2) SCC 201; B. R. Kapoor v. State of Tamil Nadu 2001 (7) SCC 231 and V. Tulasamma v. Sesha Reddy 1977 (3) SCC 99). Adopting a different approach would result in narrowing the rights and approving a judicially mandated class of restriction on the rights under the Act, which is unwarranted." (Emphasis added) It is clear from the ruling of Ravindra Bhat, J. that the PIO, who is denying information under Section 8(1) (h) of the RTI Act, must show satisfactory reasons as to why disclosure of such information would impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders. These reasons must be relevant and the opinion of the PIO that by disclosing the information, prosecution of offenders shall be impeded should be reasonable. The opinion of the PIO must be based on some material and cannot be a mere apprehension not supported by any evidence. Parliament did not intend exempting information while a process of investigation or prosecution was ongoing.Mr. Sujit Kumar Mazumder Advocate vs Cbi on 13 July, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1077181/ 4It has stated that disclosure of information can be exempted only if it impedes the process of investigation or prosecution. In the instant case, the PIO, CBI (Kolkata) has denied the information by simply quoting Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act and that such disclosure would impede the process of prosecution. However, he has failed to explain how such disclosure would actually be an impediment to the process of prosecution, as laid down above by the High Court of Delhi. The denial of information by the PIO appears to be a mere blanket statement not supported by any cogent evidence or material on the basis of which it can be clearly demonstrated that such disclosure would in fact attract the exemption contained in Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act. In other words, the PIO has failed to discharge the burden placed upon him under Section 19(5) of the RTI Act to prove that the denial of information under Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act was justified. On this basis, the Commission rejects the contention of the PIO that the information sought in queries (b), (c) and (e) was exempted under Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act. Further, the PIO, CBI (New Delhi) has denied the information sought in queries (h) and (i) on the basis of inter alia Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act. Under Section 8 (1) (j) of the RTI Act, information which has been exempted is defined as: "information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information: ..." To qualify for the exemption under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act, the information must satisfy the following criteria: 1. It must be personal information: Words in a law should normally be given the meaning given in common language. In common language, we would ascribe the adjective 'personal' to an attribute which applies to an individual and not to an institution or a Corporate. Therefore, it flows that 'personal' cannot be related to institutions, organisations or corporates. Hence Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act cannot be applied when the information concerns institutions, organisations or corporates. 2. The phrase 'disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest' means that the information must have been given in the course of a public activity. Various public authorities in performing their functions routinely ask for 'personal' information from citizens, and this is clearly a public activity. Public activities would typically include situations wherein a person applies for a job, or gives information about himself to a public authority as an employee, or asks for a permission, licence or authorisation, or provides information in discharge of aMr. Sujit Kumar Mazumder Advocate vs Cbi on 13 July, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1077181/ 5statutory obligation. 3. The disclosure of the information would lead to unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual. The State has no right to invade the privacy of an individual. There are some extraordinary situations where the State may be allowed to invade the privacy of a citizen. In those circumstances special provisions of the law apply usually with certain safeguards. Therefore where the State routinely obtains information from citizens, this information is in relationship to a public activity and will not be an intrusion on privacy. In the instant case, the Appellant, in queries (h) and (i), has sought names of CBI officers who have been placed in the list of 'doubtful integrity' during the period January 2006 till date and names of CBI officers against whom complaints are registered or contemplated and inquiry conducted or in progress. There is no doubt that the information sought is "personal" information as it pertains to individual CBI officers. Every public authority is required to have information including details of any complaints registered or contemplated or departmental enquiry initiated/ conducted against any of its officers as a matter of record and more so because such officers are public servants discharging public function. Any complaint registered and taken cognizance of, or inquiry conducted or in progress, by a public authority, is necessarily a public activity. Disclosure of such information cannot be construed as unwarranted invasion of privacy of the officer concerned, as it concerns issues raised in the exercise of his public activity as a public servant. Moreover, such officer is accountable to the public and therefore, every citizen has the right to obtain information that may affect such officer's credibility and integrity. It is pertinent to mention that the Supreme Court of India in Union of India v. ADR in Appeal (Civil) 178 of 2001 and W. P. (Civil) 294 of 2001 decided on 02/05/2002, observed that persons who aspire to be public servants by getting elected have to declare inter alia their property details, any conviction/ acquittal of criminal charges, etc. If persons who aspire to be public servants are required to declare such details, it is only logical that the details of any complaint registered or inquiry conducted or in progress against any officer must be considered to be disclosable. Therefore, the contention raised by the PIO, CBI (New Delhi) that the information sought under queries (h) and (i) was exempted from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act is rejected. Furthermore, in relation to queries (a), (b), (c), (e), (h) and (i), information has also been denied on the basis of Section 8(1)(g) of the RTI Act. Section 8(1)(g) of the RTI Act exempts: "information, the disclosure of which would endanger the life or physical safety of any person or identify the source of information or assistance given in confidence for law enforcement or security purposes;" In query (b), the Appellant has sought a copy of the Visitor's Register of SP, ACB- CBI (Kolkata) for a specific period. The purpose of a Visitor's Register is to record the names of all persons entering the premises of an organisation. Typically, the very nature of a Visitor's Register is such that details of persons who have already visited a premise and recorded in the register can be viewed by aMr. Sujit Kumar Mazumder Advocate vs Cbi on 13 July, 2011 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1077181/ 6subsequent visitor while filling in his details. The Appellant has not sought information regarding a specific visitor(s) and therefore, the Commission does not understand how the exemption under Section 8(1)(g) of the RTI Act is attracted in relation to query (b). As mentioned above, in queries (h) and (i), the Appellant has sought names of CBI officers who have been placed in the list of 'doubtful integrity' during the period January 2006 till date and officers against whom complaints are registered or contemplated and inquiry conducted or in progress. The Appellant has sought only the names of such officers and no other details whatsoever. Therefore, if only names of such officers are disclosed, the Commission does not accept that it would endanger their life or physical safety. In other words, the PIO, CBI (New Delhi) has failed to establish before the Commission that the denial of information in queries (h) and (i) under Section 8(1)(g) of the RTI Act was justified. However, as regards queries (a), (c) and (e), the Commission is of the opinion that there is some merit in the contention raised by the PIOs and disclosure of the information sought may attract Section 8(1)(g) of the RTI Act, if it reveals names of persons who may have provided information or witnesses. Section 10(1) of the RTI Act provides as follows: "10. Severability.- (1) Where a request for access to information is rejected on the ground that it is in relation to information which is exempt from disclosure, then, notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, access may be provided to that part of the record which does not contain any information which is exempt from disclosure under the RTI Act and which can reasonably be severed from any part that contains exempt information." Under Section 10 of the RTI Act, it is possible to severe certain portions of the information before disclosing it to an applicant to ensure that information that is exempt from disclosure under the RTI Act is not disclosed. Therefore, this Commission has decided to apply Section 10 of the RTI Act to the information sought by the Appellant on queries (a), (c) and (e).

Respondent 1 : PIO, Delhi Jal Board, Govt. of NCT of Delhi. Varunalaya Phase – II, Jhandewalan Karol Bagh, New Delhi-110005. RTI application filed on : 23/05/2008 PIO replied : 24/06/2008 First appeal filed on : 04/07/2008 First Appellate Authority order : 25/07/2008 Second Appeal filed on : 01/08/2008 The appellant had asked in his RTI a pplication (ID No. 2602) for copy of the documents submitted by Sh.

It is third party case, under the provision of the Act a letter for NOC has been issued to Show. Zile Singh at B-497, Azad Pur vide copy enclosed as Annexure “A”. 2. In response to the same, the owner Mrs. Archana Sharma has requested “not to give or allow any details through certified copies, uncertified copies of personnel inspection about the property B-497, who purchased the property from Sh. Zile Singh Ex. R.C.copy enclosed as Annexure “B” 3. This issue with the approval of Wx. Eng. (NW)-IV/Jt. Director (R) CNNW office. The First Appellate Authority ordered: “The appellant in his RTI application ha s sought certified c opies of documents submitted in respect of water connection N o. 62261K. This water connection stands at B-497, Azadpur Village, Delhi in the name of Sh. Ziley Singh a nd was sanctioned on 05/08/2000. on receipt of RTI application a matter was addressed to Sh. Ziley Singh, B-497, Azadpur Village, Delhi seeking his permission to give details of water connection sanctioned in his name to Sh. Mahesh Kumar Sharma, the appellant. In response to this a reply dated 31/05/2008 has been received from Mrs. Archana Sharma and Sh. Rakesh Kumar Sharma stating that they did not want to disclose any information regarding above property to anyone including Mr. Mahesh Kumar Sharma. A second letter was received from Mrs. Archana Sharma w/o Rakesh Kumar Sharma that she is the rightful owner of property No. B-497, Mandi rwali Gali, Village Azadpur, Delhi. and in support of that sh e has submitted a Sale Deed made by Sh. Ziley Singh in favour of Smt. Archana Sharma, wherein the said property B-497 Azadpur Village has been sold to her. The RTI Act, should be kept away from domestic squabbles and should not be used to settle personal scores in the guise of seeking disclosure of information pertaining to third party i.e. in this case the brother of the appellant. This is a case of water connection of property B-497 Azadpur Village, Delhi in the name of Sh. Ziley Singh. Sh. Ziley Singh according to the appellant has expired. However, the current owner Smt. Archana Sharma has not get th e water connection mutated in her name. in view of the death of Sh. Ziley Si ngh brought to the notic e of the appellate Authority in the RTI hearing.

The ZRO concerne d is required to thoroughly check the documents and ensure that tran sfer of ownership of the prop erty is verified before the ensure that transfer of ownership of the property is verified before the mutation is allowed.” Relevant Facts emerging during Hearing on 2 January 2009: The following were present Appellant: Mr. Mahesh Kumar Respondent: Dr. Bipin Behari repr esenting Santosh D. Vaidya PIO Third party: Mr. Rakesh Kumar Sharma on behalf of Archana Sharma The PIO has denied information saying it is third party information and the ‘third party’ Archana Sharma has objecte d. The appellant has pointed out that the information he is seeking is with regard to a meter of his deceased father Shri Zile Singh. Besides the PIO has advanced no r easons under Section 8 (1) to deny the information. Mere refusal of a ‘third party’ without any exemption clauses of Section 8 (1) being applicable cannot be a ground for refusal. The First appellate authority instead of restricting himself to deciding the matter on basis of the proviso of the RTI act has chosen to give gratuitous advice of how RTI should be used. The PIO has advanced no exemption under Section 8 (1) of the RTI Act, hence the denial of information is without any basis in law. During oral arguments the PIO claims exemption under Section 8 (1) (j) of the Act The appellant represents that he is seeking documents of his deceased father’s application, and therefore he has as much right to these documents as any one else. The third party seeks time to submit his wr itten arguments as to why the information should not be given to the appellant. The Commission agrees that the third part y must be given a chance to give his arguments. The third party will send his wr itten submissions to the appellant and the Commission before 21 January 2009. The final hearing will held on 2 February 2009 at 5.00pm Relevant facts emerging at Hearing on 2 February 2009: Present on 2 February 2009 Appellant: Mr. Mahesh Kumar Sharma Respondent: Mr. Paras Ram PIO Third Party: Mr. Gaurav Kumar Mehta on behalf of Archana Sharma Mr. Gaurav Kumar contends that he has the prerogative to decide whether to provide information as he is th ird party. He says that he fe els that the order of the PIO and the First appellate authority is co rrect and his submissions made to the Commission on 21 January 2009 must be ta ken into account when deciding the matter. The information sought by the appellant ha s no relationship to Public interest. The credentials of the informati on-seeker must be ascertained. The respondent contends that the inform ation is provided by the consumer in a fiduciary relationship and hence cannot be given. The appellant contends that the connectio n was of his father and he has equal right to get the information and that nobody can claim exclusive thir d party rights for this information. The aim of transparency needs to be achieved, which will be achieved if information is made available. Th ere is no violation of privacy, nor are the documents in what could be called private. The decision is reserved. Order pronounced on 27 February: The Commission has recorded the oral contentions of the appellant and the third party. It is now addressing the issues presented by the third party in its written submissions. In paragraph 14 of the written submissions by the third party it has been claimed that Parliament/State Legislature can be denied information relating to a ‘third party’. This claim has no basis and is a clear misinterpretati on of the law. At paragraph 15 it further states that disclo sing the information has no relationship to public activity or interest and that giving th e information would result in unwarranted invasion of her privacy given under Article 21 of the Constitution. In paragraph 16 and 17 of the written submissions the appellant has cited a judgment of the Hon’ble High Court of Gujara t in the Special Civil Application nos. 16073 & 17067 of 2007 decided on 16/8/2007 (2008(2) RTI 461). The appellant quotes from the judgment, “…… looking to the provision of Section 11(1) of the Act, 2005, the words, th e information ‘relating to or is supplied by the third party’ are such that it is for the third party to point out to the Public Information Officer sought for, to be disclo sed supplied is treated as confidential but, third party can make a submission that now it is treating the said information as confidential. More so, when information is ‘relating to third party’ it may not be even know to that third party when and what information relating to third party, was collected by public body…….............. What is confidential to the third party is known to the third party alone. There may not be a rubber stamp upon the information that this is confidential information. It is ri ght vested in the thir d party to treat any information ‘relating to or supplied by the third party’ as confidential.” The said judgment also says, “What satisfaction must be arrived at, prior to disclosure of information about satisfaction must be a rrived at, prior to the Act especially Section 8(d) , 8(j) and proviso to Section 11(1) and looking to the process of disclosing information to the appellant ‘rela ting to or supplied by the third party and treated as confidential by the third party’, the Act imposes a duty upon Public Information Officer to arrive at a conclusi on that public interest in disclosure outweighs, harm or injury, to the protected in terest of such third party, or larger public interest warrants, disclosure of su ch information, in considering whether the public interest in disclosure outweighs in importance any possibl e harm or injury to the interest of such third party, the Public Information Officer will have to consider the following: (i) The objections raised by the third party by claiming confidentiality in respect of the informati on sought for. (ii) Whether th e information is being sought by the applicant in larger public interest or to wreak vendetta against the third party. In deciding that the profile of person seeking information and his credentials will have to be looked into. If the profile of the person seeking information, in light of other attending circumstances, leads to th e construction that under the pretext of serving public interest, such person is ai ming to settle pers onal score against the third party, it cannot be said that public interest warrants disclosure of the information solicited. (iii) The Public Info rmation Officer, while dealing with the information relating to or supplied by the third party, has to constantly bear in mind that the Act does not become a tool in hands of a busy body to settle a personal score.” To summarize the contentions of the third party for not disclosing the information: 1. The information has been give n in a fiduciary relationship. 2. Disclosing it would be an intrusion on his privacy. 3. Third party has the right to refuse to divulge with information relating to him and unless a large Public interest can be established, the information will not be disclosed. The third party has also sought to justify his claim for denial of information by taking support from the judgment of Hon’ ble High Court of Gujarat, which has been quoted above. The main points whic h appear to arise out of the said judgment are: a) It is necessary that a larger Public inte rest must be justifie d and the purpose of the applicant and his profile and credentials looked at. b) The Public information officer is char ged with the duty to ensure that the Right does not become a tool in the hands of a busy body. Before we look at these objections and claim of exemption it will be worthwhile to look at some of the provisions of the RTI act relevant to this case: The preamble which is defines the purpose and essence of the Act: ‘WHEREAS the Constitution of India has established democratic Republic; AND WHEREAS democracy requires an info rmed citizenry and transparency of information which are vital to its functioning and also to contain corruption and to hold Goverments and their instrumentalities accountable to the governed; AND WHEREAS revelation of information in act ual practice is likely to conflict with other public interests including efficient ope rations of the Governments, optimum use of limited fiscal resources and the preser vation of confidentia lity of sensitive information; AND WHEREAS it is necessary to harmoni se these conflicting interests while preserving the paramountcy of the democratic ideal; NOW, THEREFORE, it is expedi ent to provide for furnishing certain information to citizens who desire to have it’. Section 3 of the Act defines the pur pose of the Act very succinctly: ‘Subject to the provisions of this Act, all citizens shall have the right to information .’ With a great economy of words this section is perhaps the most important section of the RTI Act 2005. The Sovereign Citizen of India has the right to access all information since he owns it, and this right may be curtailed only by the limited provisions of this Act. Section 4 imposes a duty on all Public Auth orities to declare most information Suo moto: ‘4. (1) Every public authority shall (a) maintain all its records duly catalogued and indexed in a manner and form which facilitate s the right to information under this Act and ensure that a ll records that are appropriate to be computerised are, with in a reasonable tim e and subject to availability of resources, com puterised and connected through a network all over the country on different systems so that access to such records is facilitated; (b) publish within one hundred and twenty days from the enactment of this Act,- (i) the particulars of its organisation, functions and duties; (ii) the powers and duties of its officers and employees; (iii) the procedure followed in the decision making process, including channels of supe rvision and accountability; (iv) the norms set by it for the discharge of its functions; (v) the rules, regula tions, instructions, manuals and records, held by it or under its control or used by its employees for discharging its functions; (vi) a statement of the catego ries of documents that are held by it or under its control; (vii) the particulars of any arrangement that exists for consultation with, or repres entation by, the members of the public in relation to the formulation of its policy or implementation thereof; (viii) a statement of the boards, councils, committees and other bodies consisting of two or more persons constituted as its part or fo r the purpose of its advise, and as to whether meetings of those boards, councils, committees and other bodies are open to the public, or the minutes of such meetings are accessible for public; (ix) a directory of its officers and employees; (x) the monthly remunerati on received by each of its officers and employees, in cluding the system of compensation as provided in its regulations; (xi) the budget allocated to each of its agency, indicating the particulars of all plans, proposed expenditures and reports on disbursements made; (xii) the manner of execution of subsidy programmes, including the amounts allo cated and the details of beneficiaries of such programmes; (xiii) particulars of recipients of concessions, permits or authorisations granted by it; (xiv) details in respect of the information, available to or held by it, reduced in an electronic form; (xv) the particulars of faciliti es available to citizens for obtaining information, includi ng the working hours of a library or reading room, if maintained for public use; (xvi) the names, designations and other particulars of the Public Information Officers; , (xvii) such ot her information as may be prescribed; and th ereafter update these publ ications every year; (c) publish all relevant facts while formulating important policies or announcing the decisions which affect public; (d) provide reasons for its administrative or quasi judicial decisions to affected persons; (2) It shall be a constant endeavour of every public authority to take steps in accordance with the requirements of clause (b) of sub-section (1) to provide as much information suo moto to the public at regular intervals through various means of communications, including internet, so that the pub lic have minimum resort to the use of this Act to obtain information. (3) For the purposes of sub-section (1), every information shall be disseminated widely and in such form and manner which is easily accessible to the public. (4) All materials shall be disseminated taking into consideration the cost. effectiveness, local language and the most effective method of communication in that local area and the information should be easily accessible, to the extent possible in electronic format with the Central Public Information Officer, or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, available free or at such cost of the medium or the print cost price as may be prescribed. Explanation: For the purposes of sub-sections (3) and (4 ), "disseminated" means making known or communicated th e information to the public through notice boards, newspapers, public announcements, media broadcasts, the internet or any other means, including inspection of offices of any public authority.’ It will be important to note that in Subs ection 1 (b) (xii) & (xiii) the Act mandates that Public authorities will Suo Moto declare de tails of beneficiaries of subsidy programs as well as particulars of recipients of con cessions, permits or authorisations granted by it. Section 6 (2) states, ‘ An applicant making request fo r information shall not be required to give any reason for requesting the information or any other personal details except those that may be necessary for contacting him.’ Section 8 (1) specifies the information whic h is exempted. The relevant provisions in this case are ‘Notwithst anding anything contained in th is Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen,- (e) information available to a person in his fiduciary relationship, unless the competent authority is satisfied that th e larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information; and (j) information which relates to personal in formation the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or in terest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of th e individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest ju stifies the disclosure of such information:’ Parliament has clarified the exemptions of Section 8 (1) with the proviso, ‘Provided that the information, which cannot be denied to the Parliament or a State Legislature shall not be denied to any person.’ With this sentence Parliament has rec ognized that the indi vidual Citizen,- the sovereign of this democracy,- gives it legi timacy, and therefore its right to get information cannot exceed the right of its master. In Section 8 (2) it states, ‘Notwithstanding anything in the Official Secrets Act, 1923 nor any of the exemptions permissible in accordance with sub-se ction (1), a public authority may allow access to information, if p ublic interests in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests.’ Even if the exemptions of Section 8 (1) apply in a particular matter, if there is larger public interest, information shall be disclosed. It is useful to comment here that an applicant does not have to show any public interest for disclosure of any information, unless a specific exemption under Section 8 (1) is established. After twenty years have elapsed, Parliament has whittled down the ten exemptions of Section 8 (1) to just thre e with the proviso 8 (3), ‘ Subject to the provisions of clauses (a), (c) and (i) of s ub-section (1), any information relating to any occurrence, event or matter which has taken place, o ccurred or happened twenty years before the date on which any request is made under sec tion 6 shall be provid ed to any person making a request under that section:’ Section 11 of the RTI act, which is the ba sis on which the information is sought to denied to the appellant in the present case lays down: ‘11. (1) Where a Central Public Informati on Officer or the State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, intends to disclose any information or record, or part thereof on a request made under this Act, which. relates to or has been supplied by a third party and has been treated as confidential by that third party, the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, shall, within five days from the receipt of the request, give a written notice to such third party of the request and of the fact that the Central Public Information Office r or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, intends to disclose the information or record, or part thereof, and invite the third party to make a submission in writing or orally, regarding wh ether the information should be disclosed, and such submission of the third party shall be kept in view while taking a decision about disclosure of information: Provided that except in the case of trade or commercial secrets protected by law, disclosure may be allowed if the public interest in disclosure out weighs in importance any possible harm or injury to the interests of such third party. (2) Where a notice is served by the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, under sub-section (1) to a third party in respect of any information or record or part thereof, the third party shall, within ten days from the date of receipt of such notice, be given the opportun ity to make representation against the proposed disclosure. (3) Notwithstanding anything containe d in section 7, the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, shall, within forty days after receipt of the request under section 6, if the third party has be en given an opportunity to make representation under sub-section (2), make a decision as to whether or not to disclose the information or record or part thereof and give in writing the notice of his d ecision to the third party. (4) A notice given under sub-section (3 ) shall include a statement that the third party to whom the notice is gi ven is entitled to prefer an appeal under section 19 against the decision.’ There are some peculiar matters in the pres ent case. The information belongs to the late Mr. Zile Singh not to Ms. Archan a Sharma who has objected. Besides the appellant claims to be the son of the late Mr . Zile Singh, which is contested by the third party. The Commission does not find it necessary to rule on these matters. The Commission will first deal with the contentions of the third party: 1. The information has been given in a fiduciary relationship. The third party is invoking the protection of Section 8 (1) (e ) of the RTI act. A fiduciary relationship is one where th e key element is that the relationship is principally characterized by trust and the information is given for use only for the benefit of the giver. Here the information has been given as per the rules to get an authorization to get a water connection, from the Publ ic authority. The traditional definition of a fiduciary is a person who occupies a position of trust in relation to someone else, therefore requiring him to act fo r the latter's benefit within the scope of that relationship. In business or law, we generally mean someone who has specific duties, such as those that attend a particular profession or role, e.g.,financial analyst or trustee. In the instant case a key element of th e relationship between the applicant for a water connection and the Delhi Jal Board certa inly cannot be said to be primarily of trust by the applicant in the Public authority, nor can it be said that the information was given for the benefit of the giver. The information was provided to get an authorization for a water connection. 2. Disclosing it would be an intrusion on his privacy. The third party is invoking the protection of Section 8 (1) (j ) of the RTI act. Under Section 8 (1) (j) information whic h has been exempted is defined as: "information which relates to personal info rmation the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or in terest, or which woul d cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unl ess the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger publ ic interest justifies the disc losure of such information:" To qualify for this exemption the information must satisfy the following criteria: 1. It must be personal information. Words in a law should normally be given the meanings given in common language. In common language we would ascribe the adjec tive 'personal' to an attribute which applies to an individual and not to an Institut ion or a Corporate. From this it flows that 'personal' cannot be related to Institutions , organisations or cor porates. ( Hence we could state that Section 8 (1) (j) cannot be applied when the information concerns institutions, organisations or corporates.). The phrase 'disclosure of which has no relati onship to any public activity or interest' must be interpreted means that the information must have some relationship to a Public activity. Various Public authorities in performing th eir functions routinely ask for 'personal' information from Citizens, and this is clearl y a public activity. When a person applies for a job, or gives information about himself to a Public authority as an employee, or asks for a permission, licence or authorisa tion, all these are public activities. We can also look at this from another as pect. The State has no right to invade the privacy of an individual. There are some ex traordinary situations where the State may be allowed to invade on the privacy of a Citizen. In those circumstances special provisos of the law apply, always with cert ain safeguards. Therefore it can be argued that where the State routinely obtains informa tion from Citizens, this information is in relationship to a public activity and w ill not be an intrusion on privacy. Certain human rights such as libert y, freedom of expression or right to life are universal and therefore woul d apply uniformly in all Countries uniformly. However, the concept of 'privacy' is re lated to the society and differe nt societies’ would look at these differently. India has not codified this right so far, hence in balancing the Right to Information of Citizens and the individual' s Right to Privacy the Citizen's Right to Information would be given greater weightage. Therefore we can accept that disc losure of informatio n which is routinely collected by the Public aut hority and routinely provided by individuals, would not be an invasion on the privacy of an individual and there will only be a few exceptions to this rule which might relate to information which is obtained by a Public authority while using extraordinary pow ers such as in the case of a raid or phone-tapping. 3. Third party has the right to refuse to di vulge with information relating to him, and unless a large Public interest can be established, the information will not be disclosed. No legal provision has been cited. We will now look at the main contentions relied upon by the third party from the judgement of the Hon’ble Gujarat High Court: a) It is necessary that a larger Public interest must be justified and the purpose of the applicant and his pr ofile and credentials looked at. b) The Public information officer is ch arged with the duty to ensure that the Right does not become a tool in the hands of a busy body. The Right to Information is a fundamental right of Citizens. The Act has elegantly and crisply defined its objective in Section 3 where it states ‘ Subject to the provisions of this Act, all citizens shall have the right to information .’ The test of public interest is to be applied to give information, only if any of the exemptions of Section 8 a pply. Even if the exemptions apply, the Act enjoins that if there is a larger Public interest, the information would still have to be given. There is no requirement in the Act of establishing any public interest for information to be obtained by the sovereign Citizen; nor is th ere any requirement to establish larger Public interest, unless an exemption is he ld to be valid. Insofar as looking at the credentials of the applicant are concerned, th e lawmaker has categori cally stated that in Section 6 (2) , ‘ An applicant making request for in formation shall not be required to give any reason for requesting the inform ation or any other personal details except those that may be necessary for contacting him.’ Since the law categorically states that no information shall be required be supplied by the ap plicant except those that may be necessary for contacting him, it is clea r that the credentials of the applicant are of no relevance, and are not to be ta ken into account at all when giving the information. Truth remains the Truth and it is not important who access it. If there is a larger Public interest in disc losing a Truth, it is not relevant who gets it revealed. Hence we respectfully disagree with the contention of the Hon’ble Gujarat High Court. Under this Act, providing information is the rule and denial an exception. Any attempt to constrict or deny information to the Sovereign Citizen of India without the explicit sanction of the law will be going agai nst the rule of law. The Citizen needs to give no reasons nor are his credentials to be checked for giving the information. If the third party objects to giving the information, the Public Information Officer must take his objections and see if any of the exempti on clauses of Section 8 (1) apply. If the any of the exemption clauses apply, the PIO is then obliged to see if there is a larger Public interest in disclosure. If none of the exemption clauses apply, information has to be given. The third party’s objections made before the Commission about the exemptions of Section 8 (1) (e) & (j) are disallowed. Hence the information would have to be given. Decision : The Appeal is allowed. The PIO will give the information to the appellant before 15 March 2009. Notice of this decision be given free of cost to the parties.

JUDGMENT 1. In the present petition fi led under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, the petitioner has prayed to set aside order dated 26.02.2013 passed by the Central Information Commissioner -respondent No.3 herein. The petitioner has further prayed for setting aside order dated 22.09.2 009 as also order dated 14.12.2010 passed by respondent No.1 herein -Public Information Officer and respondent No.2 -appellate authority under the Right to Information Act, 2005, respectively. A direction is also prayed for aga inst respondent Nos.1 and 2 req uiring them to supply information to the petitioner demanded by the petitioner. 2. The impugned order dated 26.02.2013 passed by the Central Information Commissioner in its relevant and material part reads as under: "6. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the cas e of Girish Ramchandra Deshpande dated October 3, 2012 had observed that Income Tax Returns was personal information and exempt from disclosure u/s 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act unless it was felt that a larger public interest was served. In the instant c ase, no such larger public interest has been shown. The ratio of the above case applies to the present appea l. The Commission concurs with the decision of the AA and the appeal is disposed of." 3. It appears that the petitioner filed an application dated 01.09.201 0 under the Right to Information Act, 2005 before the Public Information Officer of the office of the Commissioner of Income Tax, Surat, seeking certain information which included copies of income -tax returns of private respondent Nos. 4 to 8 herein. The p etitioner in his application under Section 6 of the Right to Information Act, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as "the RTI Act") stated about following details of information asked for: "Kindly find enclosed herewith the press cutting regarding the income tax violation by Tarunkumar Kantilal Raval, resident of 50, Adarsh Society, Athwa Lines, Surat and Bhadreshkumar Chimanlal Kagalwala, resident of 50, Adarsh Society, Athwa Lines, Surat. Kindly find enclosed herewith the relevant documents regarding three diff erent proceedings –(1) regarding becoming the agriculturist on the basis of the Will of one Lalabhai Kikabhai in the year 1981 by aforesaid two persons and othe r associates namely Harishchandra Chhaganlal Jani, Resident of 6/D Rudraksh Apartment, Opp. Ariha nt Complex, Parle point, Surat; Pankajbhai Harishchandra Jani, Resident of 6/D Rudraksh Apartment, Opp. Arihant Complex, Parle Point, Surat; Pravinchandra Thakorlal Dalal, resident of 10/B Rudraksha Apartment, Near Hotel Holiday Inn, Athwa Lines, Surat; Ba lkrishna Thakore; (2) becoming the agriculturist on the basis of the Will of one Mansinh Dharsinh after the year 1977 and purchasing the agricultural land at village: Kosamba in the year 1988. It is claimed by all these pe ople that they were agriculturists and were doing the agriculture activities right from their birth which is a claim made before the Civil Court in Probate Application No. 21 of 1991. However, before the Revenue Authorities their claim was based on the Will of the deceased Lallubhai in the year 1981 wherein no such claim of being the agriculturists or holding the agriculture land from the childhood was made. In the order by the Additional Mamlatdar and Krushi Panch in Ganot Case No. 94 of 2003 they claimed to be the agriculturists and accou nt holder right from the birth and even claimed that their father and forefather were also agriculturists. Thus, everywhere there are different false cla ims made before the different authorities and fraud is played by all these people upon the Revenue Auth orities as well as the Gujarat Revenue Tribunal. From the press reports, it is very clear that there is serious violation of Income Tax Act on the part of these people and if the following information is supplied to the applicant, such fraudsters will be f urther exposed and their scandal in violation of the various laws of the State Government and Central Government may be surfaced. (1) It is requested to supply the copies of the income tax returns with all annexures regarding all aforesaid persons namely Tarunkumar Kantilal Raval, Bhadreshkumar Chimanlal Kagalwala, Harishchandra Chhaganlal Jani, Pankajbhai Harishchandra Jani, Pravinchandra Thakorlal Dalal and Balkrishna Thakore from the year 1980 to 2010 so that whether these people were holding any agric ulture land as claimed before the Revenue Authority can be ascertained, whether they had any agricultural income or not can be ascertained, whether on the basis of the so -called bogus Wills how many agricultural lands purchased by such non -agriculturists, were sold by them in violation of the provisions of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act can be ascertained, whether these persons have shown any agricultural income so as to avoid the payment of income tax, on their business income. (2) Kindly note that the provisions of Sections 8, 9, 11 and 24 are not attracted in the present case. If the information is supplied it will expose the misdeeds committed by the aforesaid persons before the Revenue Authorities and before the Income Tax Author ity and, therefore, the supply of the information would be in public interest also. There is no question of any harm in disclosing the information to such people inasmuch as the public interest in discloser outweighs the harm to the protected interest of such individual persons. According to my knowledge, the information provided in the form of income tax returns is not treated as confidential by the aforesaid parties but even if it is treated as confidential the same can be given by your office under Secti on 11 of the Act. At the instance of Tarunkumar Kantilal Raval and his associates I am falsely involved in criminal cases and my human rights are violated and, therefore even according to Section 24 of the Act information requires to be supplied and under first proviso of sub -section (1) of section 7, the information is required to be supplied within 48 hours of the receipt of this request." 3.1 It appears that between the petitioner and private respondents there simmered a property dispute and proceedings before the revenue authority with regard to the property bearing survey No.64, Block No. 160 situated at Village Bharthana Taluka Choryasi District Surat, have been pending. The facts relating to the kind, nature and contours of the said civil dispute cou ld be gathered from the pleadings of Special Civil Application No. 14842 of 2010 filed by this very petitioner wherein private respondents herein are a lso party respondents. Copy of said Special Civil Application NO. 14842 of 2010 is made part of the reco rd of this petition. It appears that the private respondents have claimed that they have become the owners of the agricultural land being survey No.64, Block No.160 of Village Bharthana, Taluka Choryasi, Surat, by virtue of Will executed by deceased Lalabha i Kikabhai who expired on 28.06.1981 and entry in the revenue record was effected in favour of the respondents. The Will was registered on 05.09.1981 afte r 2½ years from the date of death of Lalabhai. The present petitioner has disputed the said Will. The proceedings before the revenue authority are afoot between the parties. The entry No.690 which was recorded pursuant to the Will came to be upheld by the Mamlatdar, but the Deputy Collector cancelled the same. 3.2 In the aforementioned Special Civil Applic ation No.14842 of 2010 preferred by the petitioner, the pleadings set out in detail reveal the dispute between the petitioner and the respondents with regar d to the said Will. In the said petition, the petitioner has prayed for a direction to the responden t authorities to hold inquiry in the matter of purchase of different agricultural lands by the private respondents and to consider petitioner's various applications made requesting for investigation. As noted above, the case of the petitioner is about crea tion of fraudulent documents by the private respondents and regarding purchase of agricultural land since 1977 till date in the different villages of Surat on the basis of a Will. 3.3 Coming back to the controversy, respondent No.1 -Public Information Offic er denied the information on the ground that Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act exempted the information asked for by the petition er. The petitioner preferred first appeal before the appellate authority -Joint Commissioner of Income Tax. The first appellate aut hority taking view that the information asked for was in respect of third parties, issued notice for their objection or consent for giving the information. All the private parties abo ut whom the information was sought for, attended the proceedings and file d written submissions and objected to parting of the information in favour of the petitioner. The first appellate authority thereafter dis missed the appeal on the ground that the case falls within the purview of Section 8(e) of the Act. It appears t hat against the said order of the first appellate authority, the petitioner had filed Special Civil Applica tion No. 3275 of 2011. The same was withdrawn as per order dated 11.03.2011 for approaching the appropriate authority. The petitioner thereafter preferred s econd appeal under Section 9 of the Act before the Central Information Commission. It is the order of the Central Information Commission dated 26.02.2013, whic h is the subject matter of consideration having been impugned in this petition. 4. Learned advoca te Mr. N. M. Kapadia for the petitioner assailed the impugned order on the ground that it was unreasoned order. According to him, it was cryptic in nature. He relied on decision of the Su preme Court in Namita Sharma v. Union of India [2013] 1 SCC 745, in p articular paragraphs 98, 99 and 100 thereof, to pinpoint the importance of providing reasons in the order which may be passed by the jud icial or quasi -judicial forum. It was submitted that the Central Information Commission being the quasi -judicial commiss ion, was duty bound to pass reasoned order and the impugned order being non-speaking one, was liable to be quashed on that ground itself, submitted learned advocate for the petitioner. 4.1 Learned advocate for the petitioner further submitted that authorit ies have relied on different grounds to deny the information. It was submitted that the Public Information Officer did not accept the req uest for furnishing information on the ground that the information requested for was exempted under Section 8 of the Ri ght to Information Act; whereas the first appellate authority took it on a different ground and rejected the appeal. Learned advocate in the next submitted that the information asked for was the c opies of Income -Tax Returns and furnishing of which had a pu blic interest aspect. According to learned advocate, the private parties whose details and the copies of Returns were asked for, had committed illegality in getting declared for themselves a status of agriculturists. He submitted that from the information, if supplied, fraudulent conduct of the said parties would come to fore. It was therefore submitted by learned advocate that respondent No.3 wrongly applied decision of the Supreme Court in Girish Ramchandra Deshpande v. Central Information Commissioner [2013] 351 ITR 472/[2012] 211 Taxman 46/25 taxmann.com 525 to dismiss the appeal of the petitioner. It was the submission of learned advocate for the petitioner that the information asked for by t he petitioner herein, would have, when supplied, served the public interest, therefore even if the information was relating to the private parties, it was not exempted from being supplied under Section 8(j) of the Act as in disclosure thereof, there w as an overriding public interest. Learned advocate therefore submitted that respondent No.3 -Central Information Commissioner erred in appreciating the facts of the case vis -à-vis the ratio of Girish Ramchandra Deshpande (supra ) to hold that there was no larger public interest to be served. 5. As seen above, the information in the present case asked for by the petitioners pertains to private parties, namely Tarunkumar Kantilal Raval, Bhadresh Chimanlal Kagadwala, Harish Chhaganlal Jani, Pankajbhai Harishchandra J ani and Pravinchandra Thakorebhai Dalal. The petitioners asked for copies of Income -Tax Returns together with the annexures of the said parties for the period from 1980 to 2010. The said information was demanded by the petitioner on the plea that the priva te parties had conducted themselves illegally and fraudulently, that they had acquired a status of agriculturists for themsel ves on the basis of a Will of one Lalabhai which was not genuine, and that they had raised different pleas in different proceedings initiated by them before the different authorities for asserting and claiming the status as agriculturists. As was also noticed that Special Civil Application No.14842 of 2010 was filed aga inst the said private parties seeking prayers to hold inquiry and investigate in respect of the orders passed by the Revenue Tribunal in favour of the said private parties. The petitioner's say while demanding the information in question before the information authorities was that disclosure of the information demanded w ould help to ascertain whether those parties had shown any agriculture income in their Income -Tax Returns and thereby avoided paying the income -tax. 5.1 Section 8 of the Right to Information Act, 2005 enlists categories of information which are exempted from disclosure and for which the authorities are not under obligation to part with. Clause (j) of S ection 8 is with regard to the information which is pe rsonal information in nature. The relevant provision of Section 8 is extracted herein: "8. Exemption from disclosure of information .—(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen — (e) information avail able to a person in his fiduciary relationship, unless the competent authority is satisfied that the larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information; (g) information, the disclosure of which would endanger the life or physical safety of any person or identify the source of information or assistance given in confidence for law enforcement or security purposes; (j) information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interes t, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information:" 5.2 From the above provision, it is clear that the information which is personal information having no relationship with any public activity and having no nexus with public interest, the information whic h would result into unwarranted invasion of privacy, are not liable to be disclosed, the caveat being if the Information Officer/Appellate Authority is satisfied that in disclosure of such information larger p ublic interest would be served. In other words, if l arger public interest justifies the disclosure of personal information, the same may be allowed to be disclosed and the same may be furnished. 5.3 The Apex Court in Girish Ramchandra Deshpande (supra ) had an occasion to consider the scope, purport and impo rt of Section 8(1)(j). In that case, the petitioner had sought for copies of memos, show cause notices and the letter of censure/punishment awarded to the government officer by his employer , the details of movable and immovable properties of the government officer, his investments, loans and borrowings from banks and other financial institutions, gifts issued by him and his family members a t his son's marriage, etc. This information had found place in the Income -Tax Returns. The Supreme Court treated it to be a personal information exempted from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act. 5.3.1 The Apex Court stated: 'The performance of an employee/officer in an organization is primarily a matter between the employee and the employer and normally those aspects are governed by the service rules which fall under the expression "personal information", the disclosure of wh ich has no relationship to any public activity or public interest. On the other hand, the disclosure of which would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of that individual. Of course, in a given case, if the Central Public Informatio n or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information, appropriate orders could be passed but the petitioner cannot claim those details as a matter of right.' (Para 12) 5.3.2 It was held: 'The details disclosed by a person in his income tax returns are "personal information" which stand exempted from disclosure under clause (j) of Section 8(1) of the RTI Act, unless involves a larger public interest and the Central Public Inf ormation Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of suc h information.' (Para 13) 6. Now, turning to the facts of the present case, it is evident that t he kind and nature of the information demanded by the petitioner clearly falls within the expression "personal information". The personal character of the information demanded in the nature of Income -Tax Returns of the private parties to get disclosure abo ut the payment of tax by them which was again in order to know about their status as agriculturists declared to be so by the authorities in the legal proceedings, could be indeed said t o be personal. It was in the background of litigation between the petit ioner and the said private persons relating to their property rights wherein the Will in favour of private parties was disputed and the disputes of civil nature were being agitated before the forum concerned and the court. This information being personal in nature, could not be claimed as a matter of right by the petitioner, rather they were clearly exempt ed information under Section 8(1)(j). The contention of larger public interest justifying the disclosur e does not exist. In disclosing the said informatio n asked for by the petitioner relating to the private parties, there was no element of public interest to be sub -served. The information was personal information relating to third parties. The attendant facts and circumstances and the litigation between th e petitioner and those parties, instead indicated that the information was personal information which was asked for by the petitioner for his own personal interest and private purpose. Respondent No.3 -Central Information Commissioner was eminently justifie d in taking a view that there was no public interest present in the information claimed to be supplied, rightly denying the same by dismissing the appeal. 7. Lastly but importantly, dealing with the contention raised on behalf of the petitioner that the im pugned order passed by the Central Information Commission was an unreasoned order, and therefore the same was required to be set aside, it was not possible to countenance the same. It is correct to view the impugned order as one not providing reasons or to perceive it to be a cryptic or an unreasoned order. 7.1 An order which discloses a reason, may be a one -line reason, is a reasoned order. If the reason supplied by the authority for its decision answers the issue, howsoever short it may be, it would satis fy the requirements of being a speaking order. Where an application of mind is disclosed and a conclusion i s supported in certain credible and convincing way, it amounts to supplying reasons. An order which is communicative for the ground on which it is ba sed can be said to be a speaking order and a reasoned order. It is the vitality of the reasons supplied, and not the verbosity in the reasons narrated, that matt ers. The impugned order mentions that in the petitioner's case, no larger interest was shown, t herefore as held by the Supreme Court in Girish Ramchandra Deshpande (supra ), in view of the provisions of section 8(1)(j) of the Act, the information was exempt from disclosure. This order can be hardly characterized as an unreasoned order, much less a cr yptic order. When the order in question supplies and communicates a ground that the decision taken is based on the ratio of the decision by the Apex Court decision, it would be a good, adequate and wholesome reasoning. Such order can be said to be eminentl y a reasoned order. 8. Learned advocate lastly requested that this Court may at least make certain observations that the revenue authorities before whom the proceedings are pending, may ask the respondents to produce the documents. The request is hardly de serves to be acceded. No such observation can be made in the present proceedings. The prayer is not only not justified, but it is beyond the scope of the subject matter of the present petition. Lastly, it was submitted by learned advocate for the petitione r that he wanted to restrict his prayer for seeking information limited to certain documents and that in view of limited prayer restricted in the information, the court may direct the information authorities to supply such infor mation. This request again c annot be accepted. If the petitioner wants certain documents and information independently, it is always open to take recourse to the relevant provisions of the Right to Informa tion Act, 2005 by applying before the competent authority and pursue his reques t for getting such information in accordance with law. 9. For the foregoing reasons and discussion, petition deserves to be dismissed at the threshold. Accordingly this petition stands dismissed summarily.

Gross Income/Net income of my wife. Sonal Dhingra – PAN No. BAOPD5266L from AY 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021- 22.” The CPIO furnished a reply to the appellant on 02.0 2.2023 and denied the information under Section 8(1)(j) of RTI Act. Being dissatisfied, the appellant filed a First App eal dated 16.02.2023. FAA’s order, dated 07.02.2023, upheld the reply of the CP IO with the following observation- “As discussed above, the application was disposed o ff by the concerned CPIO, ITO Ward 58(7), New Delhi and information was rightly denied in view of the Hon'ble Supreme Court decision in the case o f Girish Ramchandra Deshpande Vs Central Information Commission & Ors ( SLP 27734 of 2012 dated 03.10.2012 and since information relates to p ersonal information, the disclosure of which has no relationship to any publ ic activity or interest. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed and disposed o f accordingly.” Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied, the appellant a pproached the Commission with the instant Second Appeal. Relevant Facts emerging during Hearing: The following were present:- Appellant: Represented by Adv. Anmol Malhotra present in perso n. Respondent: Prem Prakash Mehra, ITO Ward 58(7) & CPIO present i n person. Third Party: Represented by Anuj Dhingra, present in person. The written submissions filed by the Appellant and the Respondent prior to the hearing are taken on record. The Appellant stated that he has sought the income related details of his estranged wife to corroborate evidence pertaining t o a maintenance case pending against him before the Court of Law. However, he is aggrieved with the fact that the information was wrongly denied by the CPIO unde r the garb of Section 8(1)(j) of RTI Act. He urged the Commission for relief to b e granted in the matter. 3 The CPIO submitted that since the information sough t by the Appellant pertains to the personal information of the third party; the refore, it was denied to him by invoking Section 8(1)(j) of RTI Act. The Rep. of third party stated that since such reco rds have already been produced before the Civil Court during pendency of maintenance case; therefore, seeking such information through RTI channel won’t serve any public interest, as such. Decision: At the outset, it is noteworthy that this bench has dealt with cases bearing the same factual matrix and the stance that has been ma intained by it so far is that the information sought for in the RTI Application p ertains to the personal information of a third party and stands duly exempt ed under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act. In this regard, the attention of the Appel lant(s) has been drawn towards a judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the matter of Central Public Information Officer, Supreme Court of India Vs. Sub hash Chandra Agarwal in Civil Appeal No. 10044 of 2010 with Civil Appeal No . 10045 of 2010 and Civil Appeal No. 2683 of 2010 wherein the import of “personal information ” envisaged under Section 8(1)(j) of RTI Act has been exemplifi ed in the context of earlier ratios laid down by the same Court in the matter(s) of Canara Bank Vs. C.S. Shyam in Civil Appeal No.22 of 2009; Girish Ramchan dra Deshpande vs. Central Information Commissioner & Ors., (2013) 1 SCC 212 a nd R.K. Jain vs. Union of India & Anr., (2013) 14 SCC 794. The following was thus held: “59. Reading of the aforesaid judicial precedents, in our opinion, would indicate that personal records, including name, add ress, physical, mental and psychological status, marks obtained, grades an d answer sheets, are all treated as personal information. Similarly, profess ional records, including qualification, performance, evaluation reports, ACR s, disciplinary proceedings, etc. are all personal information. Med ical records, treatment, choice of medicine, list of hospitals and doctors v isited, findings recorded, including that of the family members, information r elating to assets, liabilities, income tax returns, details of investm ents, lending and borrowing, etc. are personal information . Such personal information is entitled to protection from unwarranted invasion of privacy and conditional 4 access is available when stipulation of larger publ ic interest is satisfied. This list is indicative and not exhaustive…” Further, in matters concerning the disputes of a hu sband and wife, the Commission is guided by a judgment of the Hon’ble D elhi High Court in the matter of Vijay Prakash vs. Union of India (W.P. (C) 803/2009) dated 01.07.2009 wherein the Court observed that in private disputes such as the present one between a husband and wife “…The basic protection afforded by virtue of the exemption (from disclosure) enacted under Section 8 (1)(j) cannot be lifted or disturbed..” Similarly, in the matter of Madhumala B. R. vs. ACIT, Ward 3(3)(1), Bangalore based on the same facts in File No. CIC/CCITB/A/2021/609570 , the attention of this bench was invited to the following cases filed by the Income Tax authorities in Bangalore with the Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka against the orders of the Commission wherein “gross income” of the spouse was allowed to be disclosed citing the right of maintenance: 1. Jammula Padma Manjari in W.P. No. 18778 of 2017 ( CIC/BS/A/2016/001440-BJ) 2. Gulsanober Bano in W.P. No. 34625 of 2019 ( CIC/CCITB/A/2017/180340-BJ) 3. Neena Bhatnagar Mani in W.P. No. 7367 of 2020 ( CIC/CCITB/A/2018/106268-BJ) 4. Chhavi Goel Nee Agarwal in W.P. No. 7281 of 2020 ( CIC/CCITB/A/2018/120646-BJ) 5. Devyani Lakher in W.P. No. 7453 of 2020 ( CIC/PNBNK/A/2018/104442) 6. Princy Amit Jain in W.P. No. 11233 of 2020 ( CIC/CCITB/A/2018/164565). Nonetheless, since the averred Court cases are repo rtedly under an interim stay by the Karnataka High Court and the details of the arguments or further orders are not available on record, this bench has accepte d the bar on disclosure thus far only in the Madhumala case. Per contra, in the recent past this bench has met w ith the continuing reliance placed by a staggering number of applicants on the decision dated 06.11.2020 of a coordinate bench of the Commission in the Rahmat Bano case, wherein the disclosure of the gross income was allowed to the e stranged wife on the ground of sustenance and livelihood of the family. The sai d decision was premised on the judgments of two High Courts i.e in the matter of Smt. Sunita Jain vs. Pawan Kumar Jain and others W.A. No. 168/2015 and Smt. Su nita Jain vs. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and others W.A. No. 170/2015 dated 15.05.2018 by Hon’ble MP High Court as well as Rajesh Ramachandra Kidile vs. Maharashtra SIC and O rs in 5 W.P. No. 1766 of 2016 dated 22.10.2018 by Hon’ble High Court of Bombay (Nagpur Bench). Thus, while making a reference to t he ratio laid down in the Apex Court judgement in the Girish Ramachandra (supra) case it was held as under in the Rahmat Bano case: “However, making a distinction with the said judgme nt, the Division Bench of the Hon'ble High Court of M.P. in the matter of Smt. Sunita Jain vs. Pawan Kumar Jain and others W.A. No. 168/2015 and Smt. Su nita Jain vs. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and others W.A. No. 170/2015 dated 15 .05.2018 had in a matter where the information seeker had sought the salary details of her husband from the employer held as under: "While dealing with the Section 8(1)(j) of the Act, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the appellant and the respondent No.1 are husband and wife and as a wife she is entitled to know what remuneration th e respondent No.1 is getting. Present case is distinguishable from the c ase of Girish Ramchandra Deshpande (supra) and therefore the law laid down b y their Lordships in the case of Girish Ramchandra Deshpande (supra) are not applicable in the present case. In view of the foregoing discussion, we allow the appeal and set aside the order passed by the Writ Court in W.P. No .341/2008. Similarly, the W.A. No.170/2015 is also allowed and the impugned o rder passed in W.P. No.1647/2008 is set aside." 8. Moreover, the Hon’ble High Court of Bombay (Nagp ur Bench) in the matter of Rajesh Ramachandra Kidile vs. Maharashtra SIC and Ors in W.P. No. 1766 of 2016 dated 22.10.2018 held as under: “8. Perusal of this application shows that the sala ry slips for the period mentioned in the application have been sought for b y the Advocate. As rightly submitted by the learned counsel for the pe titioner, the salary slips contain such details as deductions made from the sa lary, remittances made to the Bank by way of loan instalments, remittances made to the Income Tax Authority towards part payment of the Income Tax fo r the concerned month and other details relating to contributions made to Provident Fund, etc. It is here that the information contained in the salary s lips as having the characteristic of personal nature. Any information which discloses, as for example, remittances made to the Income tax Departm ent towards discharge of tax liability or to the Bank towards d ischarge of loan liability would constitute the personal information and would encroach upon the 6 privacy of the person. Therefore as held by the Hon ’ble Apex Court in the case of Girish Ramachandra Deshpande (supra) such a n information could not be disclosed under the provisions of the RTI Ac t. This is all the more so when the information seeker is a person who is tota lly stranger in blood or marital relationship to the person whose informatio n he wants to lay his hands on. It would have been a different matter, ha d the information been sought by the wife of the petitioner in order to su pport her contention in a litigation, which she filed against her husband. In a litigation, where the issue involved is of maintenance of wife, the information relating to the salary details no longer remain confined to the category o f personal information concerning both husband and wife, which is availabl e with the husband hence accessible by the wife. But in the present ca se, as stated earlier, the application has not been filed by the wife. 9. Then, by the application filed under the provisi ons of the RTI Act, information regarding mere gross salary of the peti tioner has not been sought and what have been sought are the details if the salary such as amounts relating to gross salary, take home salary and also all the deductions from the gross salary. It is such nature of the information sought which takes the present case towards the category o f exempted information. 10. All these aspects of the matter have not been c onsidered by the authority below and, therefore, I find that its order is pate ntly illegal, not sustainable in the eyes of law.” 9. Taking into consideration the aforementioned ana lysis and the judgments of the Higher Courts, the Commission directs the re spondent to inform the appellant about the generic details of the net taxable income/gross inc ome of her husband held and available with the Public Auth ority for the period 2017- 2018, within a period of 15 working days from the d ate of receipt of this order. Emphasis Supplied 10. The details/copy of income tax returns and othe r personal information of third party need not to be disclosed to the appe llant except as mentioned at para no. 9 above.” Therefore, applying the same yardsticks in favour o f the husbands in pursuance of the Appellant’s plea during the hearing that the in formation is being requested for corroborating the evidence in a maintenance cas e pending against him, the 7 Commission directs the CPIO to provide only the “ generic details of the net taxable income/gross income” of the Appellant’s wife for the specified time period as contained in the RTI Application to the A ppellant free of cost within 15 days from the date of receipt of this order. A comp liance report to this effect shall be sent to the Commission by the CPIO immediately t hereafter within 7 days. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.

It was issued in 1997-98 information. 2 Provide the certified Xerox copy of the date of birth certificate , Do education documents and residential proof certificates Grounds for the First Appeal: Information has been denied. Order of the FAA: Not mentioned Grounds for the Second Appeal: Information has been denied seeking exemption under section 8 (1) (j) of the RTI Act Relevant Facts emerging during Hearing: The following were present: Appellant: Mr. Narender Kumar representing Mrs Anita Singh; Respondent: Mr. P. Roychaudhuri, Advocate representing The PIO, Passport Office Bareily; The PIO has refused to give the information claiming exemption under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act. The respondent states that third party information cannot be Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104603675/ 1 Smt.Anita Singh vs Ministry Of External Affairs on 1 May, 2012 disclosed without taking the views of the third party and relied upon the case of Suhash Chakma Vs. CIC in W.P.(C) No. 9118 of 2009. The respondents also states that the present whereabouts of the third parties are not maintained by the Ministry. The Commission rules that if the third party's address is not located it does not mean the citizen's right to information would disappear. Section-11 is a procedural requirement that gives third party an opportunity to voice and objection in releasing the information. Section 11 of the RTI act, which is the basis on which the information is sought to be denied to the appellant in the present case lays down: ‘11. (1) Where a Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, intends to disclose any information or record, or part thereof on a request made under this Act, which. relates to or has been supplied by a third party and has been treated as confidential by that third party, the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, shall, within five days from the receipt of the request, give a written notice to such third party of the request and of the fact that the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, intends to disclose the information or record, or part thereof, and invite the third party to make a submission in writing or orally, regarding whether the information should be disclosed, and such submission of the third party shall be kept in view while taking a decision about disclosure of information: Provided that except in the case of trade or commercial secrets protected by law, disclosure may be allowed if the public interest in disclosure out weighs in importance any possible harm or injury to the interests of such third party. (2) Where a notice is served by the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, under sub-section (1) to a third party in respect of any information or record or part thereof, the third party shall, within ten days from the date of receipt of such notice, be given the opportunity to make representation against the proposed disclosure. (3) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 7, the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, shall, within forty days after receipt of the request under section 6, if the third party has been given an opportunity to make representation under sub-section (2), make a decision as to whether or not to disclose the information or record or part thereof and give in writing the notice of his decision to the third party. (4) A notice given under sub-section (3) shall include a statement that the third party to whom the notice is given is entitled to prefer an appeal under section 19 against the decision.’ It is evident that the PIO is expected to follow the procedure of Section 11 when he "intends to disclose any information or record". This means that the PIO has come to the conclusion that the information is not exempt as per the provisions Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104603675/ Smt.Anita Singh vs Ministry Of External Affairs on 1 May, 2012 of the RTI Act. It is clearly stated at Section 11 (1) that 'submission of third party shall be kept in view while taking a decision about disclosure of information. The information 'which. relates to or has been supplied by a third party and has been treated as confidential by that third party’. Thus the procedure of Section 11 comes into effect if the PIO believes that the information exists and is not exempt, and the third party has treated it as confidential. The PIO must send a letter to the third party within 5 days of receipt of the RTI application. It only gives the third party an opportunity to voice its objections to disclosing information. The PIO will keep these in mind and denial of information can only be on the basis of exemption under Section 8 (1) of the RTI act. As per Section 11 (3), the PIO has to determine the whether the information is exempt or not and inform the appellant and the third party of his decision. If the third party wishes to appeal against the decision of the PIO, he can file an appeal under Section 19 of the Act as per the provision of Section 11 (4). Section 11 does not give a third party an unrestrained veto to refuse disclosing information. It clearly anticipates situations where the PIO will not agree with the claim for non-disclosure by a third party and provides for a appeal to be made by the third party against disclosure, which would have been unnecessary, if the third party had been given a veto against disclosure. Thus the PIO is expected to follow the procedure of Section 11, when he intends to disclose the information but has some reason to believe that the third party treats it as confidential. If the third party sends an objection, the PIO has to determine whether the information is exempt under the provisions of the Act. The Commission however examines whether the information is exempt under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act. Under Section 8 (1) (j) information which has been exempted is defined as: "information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information:" To qualify for this exemption the information must satisfy the following criteria: 1. It must be personal information. Words in a law should normally be given the meanings given in common language. In common language we would ascribe the adjective 'personal' to an attribute which applies to an individual and not to an Institution or a Corporate. From this it flows that 'personal' cannot be related to Institutions, organisations or corporates. Hence Section 8 (1) (j) cannot be applied when the information concerns institutions, organisations or corporates. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104603675/ 3 Smt.Anita Singh vs Ministry Of External Affairs on 1 May, 2012 The phrase ‘disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest’ means that the information must have been given in the course of a Public activity. Various Public authorities in performing their functions routinely ask for ‘personal’ information from Citizens, and this is clearly a public activity. When a person applies for a job, or gives information about himself to a Public authority as an employee, or asks for a permission, licence or authorization or passport, all these are public activities. Also when a Citizen provides information in discharge of a statutory obligation this too is a public activity. We can also look at this from another aspect. The State has no right to invade the privacy of an individual. There are some extraordinary situations where the State may be allowed to invade the privacy of a Citizen. In those circumstances special provisions of the law apply;- usually with certain safeguards. Therefore where the State routinely obtains information from Citizens, this information is in relationship to a public activity and will not be an intrusion on privacy. Certain human rights such as liberty, freedom of expression or right to life are universal and therefore would apply uniformly to all human beings worldwide. However, the concept of ‘privacy’ is a cultural notion, related to social norms, and different societies would look at these differently. Therefore referring to the UK Data protection act or the laws of other countries to define 'privacy' cannot be considered a valid exercise to constrain the Citizen's fundamental Right to Information in India. Parliament has not codified the right to privacy so far, hence in balancing the Right to Information of Citizens and the individual's Right to Privacy the Citizen's Right to Information would be given greater weightage. The Supreme of India has ruled that Citizens have a right to know about charges against candidates for elections as well as details of their assets, since they desire to offer themselves for public service. It is obvious then that those who are public servants cannot claim exemption from disclosure of charges against them or details of their assets. Given our dismal record of misgovernance and rampant corruption which colludes to deny Citizens their essential rights and dignity, it is in the fitness of things that the Citizen's Right to Information is given greater primacy with regard to privacy. In view of this the Commission does not accept the PIO's contention that information provided by an applicant when applying for passport is exempt under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act. Decision: The Appeal is allowed. The PIO is directed to provide the complete information as per available records to the Appellant before 15 May 2012 This decision is announced in open chamber. Notice of this decision be given free of cost to the parties. Any information in compliance with this Order will be provided free of cost as per Section 7(6) of RTI Act.

BRIJ LAL ..... Petitioner Through: Mr. Moni Cinmoy, Adv. versus THE CENTRAL INFORMATION COMMISSION AND ORS ..... Respondents Through: None. CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE VIPIN SANGHI O R D E R 21.05.2012 C.M. No. 6593/2012 (exemption) Allowed subject to just exceptions. The application stands disposed of. 5/22/2018 delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=1 10200&yr=2012 http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=1 10200&yr=2012 2/4 W.P. (C) 3057/2012 The petitioner by this writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India assails the order dated 01.07.2011 passed by the Central Information Commissioner in Appeal No. CIC/DS/A/2010/002004. The petitioner moved a RTI application to the Commissioner of Income Tax, ITO, Aayakar Bhawan, Sanjay Place, Agra on 03.02.2010. In this application the petitioner stated that he had moved a Tax Evasion Petition (TEP), and sought the conduct of an enquiry on the known sources of income of one Shri M. P. Singh. He stated that despite passage of seven months, he had not received any response. Therefore, under the Right to Information Act, he sought information with regard to the action taken on the said complaint. This query was responded to on 09.03.2010 by the Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax/CPIO, Agra. The CPIO declined the application of the petitioner seeking direct information with regard to the sources of income of Shri M. P. Singh by placing reliance on Section 8(1)(j) on the ground that it related to a third party and disclosure of the said information was not in public interest. It appears that before disposing of the application, the CPIO also issued notice to Shri M. P. Singh and Shri M. P. Singh objected to disclosure of the information. The petitioner then preferred an appeal before the first appellate authority. The first appellate authority rejected the appeal on 29/30.04.2010, again placing reliance on Section 8(1)(j) of the Act. The petitioner then preferred a further appeal to the CIC, which has been disposed of by the impugned order. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the Joint Commissioner of Income Tax Range-5, Forozabad has declined to act on the tax revision petition of the petitioner on the ground that the information desired by the petitioner is six years old and is barred by limitation as per the provisions of Income Tax Act. It is stated that the information is not in custody of the CPIO. He also observed that Shri M. P. Singh, against whom the complaint was lodged by the petitioner, is presently assessed with ITO 3(iv), Mathura and the jurisdiction does not lie with the Joint Commissioner of Income Tax, Range-5, Firozabad. He held that since no larger public interest is involved in the matter, the petitioner?s appeal is disposed of. The submission of counsel for the petitioner is that since the TEP of the petitioner has not been actioned on account of the same being barred by limitation, effectively, the information sought by the petitioner has not been provided. Learned counsel for the petitioner places reliance on the decision5/22/2018 delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=1 10200&yr=2012 http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=1 10200&yr=2012 3/4 of this Court in W.P.(C) No. 3114/2007 in support of his submission that the respondent was neither provided information with regard to the sources of income of Shri M. P. Singh nor conducted an enquiry/investigation on the TEP of the petitioner. A perusal of the decision in Bhagat Singh vs. Chief Information Commissioner and Ors. W.P.(C) No. 3114/2007 decided on 03.12.2007 shows that in that case on the TEP action was taken, but the TEP investigation report was not provided under the Right to Information Act. All that the Court held was that the queriest was entitled to receive a copy of the said TEP investigation report. In the present case, the Joint Commissioner of Income Tax has held that the said TEP cannot be actioned as it is barred by limitation. That, in my view, is sufficient disclosure so far as the action taken on the TEP is concerned. So far as the petitioner?s grievance with regard to non supply of information with regard to sources of income of Shri M. P. Singh is concerned, in my view, the CPIO correctly relied upon Section 8(1)(j) of the Act to deny information to the petitioner. Section 8(1)(j) reads as follows:- ?8(1)(j) information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information:? The information sought by the petitioner in relation to the sources of income of Shri M. P. Singh is undoubtedly personal information, disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or public interest of, or in relation to, Shri M. P. Singh. I, therefore, find no merit in this petition. The same is dismissed.

The captioned writ petitions raise s a common question of law, which is, whether the petitioners a re obliged to furnish information to respondent which is retained with the m in the record , in the form of file notings as also the opinion of the Judge Advocate General (in short JAG) found in records of the respondents, under the relevant provisions of t he Right to Information Act, 2005 (in short the RTI Act). 1.1 In each of the matters, the Union of India (UOI) has been represented by Mr Rajeeve Mehra, ASG , while the respondents have appeared in person. Amongst the respondents, Col. V.K. Shad has appea red in person and made submission at each date , while the same cannot be said of the other two respondents , Col P.P. Singh and Brig. S. Sabharwal who have put in appearance s occasionally . In particular , they were absent on the last two dates of hearing wh en matters were heard at length and the judgment w as reserved in the matters . Nevertheless , it appears that , the said officers have adopted and are in sync, with the submissions made by Col. V.K. Shad. 1.2 The orders impugn ed in each of the captured writ petition s were t hose passed by the Central Information Commission (in short CIC) . In WP(C) 499/2012 , two orders are impugned. The principal order being order dated 15.06.2011 , followed by a consequential order , dated 13.12.2011. 1.3 In WP(C) 1138/2 012, there are , once again , two orders , which are impugned. The first order impugned is , the principal order , which is , dated 04.11.2011 . This order follows the decision taken by the CIC in Col. V.K. Shad's case. The second order is dated 05.01.2012, w hich actually , only records , the fact that the matter ha d been concluded by the order dated WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 3 of 30 4.11.2011 , and that the registry of the CIC ha d mistakenly relisted the matter. The order however , also goes on to record the fact that , a written representation was submitt ed on behalf of the petitioners herein that , they be given , thirty (30) days time to comply with the order of the CIC. 1.4 In the third and last writ petit ion being: WP(C) 1144/2012, the order impugned is dated 9.6.2011. 1.5 In each of thes e matters, the impugned orders have been passed by the same Chief Information Commissioner. 2. Though the question of law is common, for the sake of completeness, I propose to briefly touch upon the relevant facts involved in each of the matters , which led to institution of the instant writ petition s. 2.1 For the sake of convenience , however, ea ch of the respondents in their respective writ petitions will be referred to by their name. WP(C) NO. 499/2012 3. Col. V.K. Shad was posted to the Army Core Supply Battalion 5628 in September, 2008 . Evidently, he fell out with his deputy , one, Lt. Col. B.S. Goraya. Col. V.K. Shad had issues with regard to Lt. Col. B.S. Goraya, which in his perception impacted the functioning in the unit. Lt. Col. B.S. Goraya , on his part made counter allegations against Col. V.K. Shad qua issues which he regarded as infractions of standard operating procedures governing the functioning of the personnel inducted into the army. 3.1 Consequently, in May, 2009, a Court o f Inquiry was ord ered by the Head Quarter, Western Command , to inv estigate , charges of alleged acts of indiscipline leveled by Col. V.K. Shad against Lt. Co l. B.S. Goraya as also counter charges made by Lt. Col. B.S. Goraya against Col. V.K. Shad. 3.2 The inquiry ag ainst Col. V.K. Shad pertained to the following: "(i) Failure to follow laid down procedure with respect to sale of BPL watches, as a non CSD item between October, WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 4 of 30 2008 and March, 2009. (ii) Accepting money in Regt Fund Acct amounting to Rs 27,133/ - (Rupee s twenty seven thousand one hundred and thirty three only) as sponsor ship from CSD Liquor Vendors between January and February 2009. (iii) Improperly passed instructions to JC -664710W Nb Sub AR Ghose of 5682 ASC Bn, JCO in -Charge AWWA Venture Shop, to not to charge the profit of 5% on the sale of fruits and vegetables to MG -IC-Adm. MG ASC and DDST of HQ Western Command." 3.3 As regards, Lt. Col. B.S. Goraya (later on promoted as colonel) , what one was able to glean from the record is that , he was charged w ith making unwarranted allegations against his commanding officer Col. V.K. Shad , relating to counseling letters to officers ; non-payment of mess bills ; and purchase of pickle from officer's mess fund for personal use. 3.4 The Court Of Inquiry concluded its proceedings in August, 2009. The opinion of the Court Of Inquiry was as follows: "....(a) No case of financial misappropriation or malafide intention on part of IC-48682N Co. VK Shad, CO 5682 ASC B n has been ascertained by the court. (b) Actions t aken by Col VK Shad, CO 5 682 ASC Bn in all the cases examined by the court, though at places not strictly as per laid down procedures, are on issues pertaining to routine day to day functioning of the unit and did not have any serious ramifications or resu lted in any gross violation/ deviation from the accepted norms. (c) IC-46873K Lt. Col BS Goraya, 2IC, 5682 ASC Bn has apparently got into a personality clash with the CO, Vol. V.K. Shad. In the bargain, the former has attempted to polarize the Unit and in effect adversely affected the day to day functioning of the unit in gen and the CO in particular. (d) All issues which the court examined were of routine/ mundane nature and could have been resolved in the departmental channel itself. 2. The court re commends that: - (a) IC 48682N Col V K Shad, CO 5682 Bn (MT) should be suitably counselled for lapses in laid down procedures WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 5 of 30 with reference to the issues of "sale of BPL Watches", "acceptance of sponsor ship money from CSD Liquor Vendors" and "Functioning o f AWWA Venture Shop, Chandimandir". (b) IC -46873K Lt. Col B S G oraya, 2 IC 5682 ASC Bn (MT) is recommended to be posted out of the Unit forthwith as the presence of the offr in the Bn as 2 IC, is detrimental to the administrative and operational efficiency of the Bn. (c) Suitable Disciplinary/administrative action be initiated again st IC-46873K Lt Col BS Goraya for leveling baseless allegations against Col VK Shad, CO on routine/ mundane issues and acting in a manner not befitting the Second in Command of th e Bn by adversely affecting the functioning of the Bn....." 3.5 It appears that the reviewing authority, which in this case was the Commander P.H. & H.P(1) Sub Area , differed with the opinion of the Court Of Inquiry , and thus , recommended , initiation of administrative and disciplinary action against Col. V.K. Shad. In so far as Lt. Col. B.S. Goraya was concerned, in addition to initiating administrative action ; a recommendation was also made that , he should be posted out of the unit forthwith as the prese nce of the said officer in the battalion as the second -in- command was detrimental to the administrative and operational efficiency of the Battalion. 3.6 The matter reached the next level of command which was the General Officer Commanding (GOC) Head Quarters 2 Corps (GOC -in-Chief) . 3.7 The GOC -in-Chief, while partially agree ing with the findings and opinion of the Court Of Inquiry , noted that, it agreed with the recommendations of the Commander P.H. & H.P. (1) Sub Area. In conclusion the GOC -in-Chief , while recommending administrative action against both Col. V.K. Shad and Lt. Col. B.S. Goraya ; and concurring with the view that Lt. Col. B.S. Goraya needed to be posted outside the battalion 5682 - proceeded to convey his severe displeasure (non -recorda ble) to Col. WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 6 of 30 V.K. Shad. 3.8 This direction was issued on 10.7.2010 , though after a show cause notice was issued to Col. V.K. Shad on 8.4.2010, to which he was given an opportunity to file his defence/ reply. 4. It is in this background that Col. V.K. Sh ad vide an application dated 23.8.2010 , took recourse to the RTI Act seeking information with regard to the following: "(a) Opinion and findings of the C of I convened by the convening order ref in para 1 above. (b) Recommendations on file of staff at va rious HQs. (c) Recommendations of Cdrs in chain of comd. (d) Directions of the GOC -in-C on the subject inquiry. (e) Copies of all letters written by Lt. Col. B.S. Goraya where he has leveled allegations against me to HQ Western Command including those w ritten to HQ Corps and HQ PH & HP(1) Sub Area till date. I may also be info of action taken, if any, against Lt Col BS Goraya for his numerous acts of indiscipline." 5. The PIO , vide communication dated 29.9.2010 , declined to give any information. The said communication, however, did indicate that under Army Rule 184 (Amended) , the statement of exhibits of the Court Of Inquiry proceedings are made available to those persons whose character and military reputation is in issue in the proceedings before th e Court Of Inquiry . The officer was advised by the said communication to apply accordin gly. 6. Being aggrieved , Col. V.K. Shad , approached the first appellate authority . The first app ellate authority agreed with the view taken by the PIO except , with regard to , the denial of access to letters written by Lt. Col. B.S. Goraya to the Head Quarte rs, Western Command including those written to Head Quarter 2 Corps and Head Quarters PH & HP (1) Sub Area. The rationale employed by the first appellate authori ty was that once investigation were over, copies of letters written by Lt. Goraya uptil March, 2010 could be WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 7 of 30 provided to Col. V.K. Shad . In addition to the above, a further direction was issued , which was, to inform Col. V.K. Shad as regards the action , if any, initiated, against Lt. Col. B.S. Goraya. 7. Not being satisfied, Col. V.K. Shad , approached the CIC . The CIC , vide order dated 15.06.2011 , directed the petitioners to supply to Col. V.K. Shad , the entire information , to the extent not supplied, within a period of four weeks from the date of the order . 8. Since , there was a failure , on the part of the petitioner s to comply with the directions of the CIC, within the time stipulated, a complaint was lo dged by the Col. V.K. Shad , with the CIC , on 2.8. 2011. Accordingly, a show cause notice was issued by the CIC , on 6.9.2011 , to the PIO , Head Quarter Western Command. The notice was made returnable on 27.9.2011. 8.1 Vide communication dated 19.9.2011 , the hearing before the CIC was reschedul ed for 5. 10.2011. By yet another notice dated 26.9.2011, the hearing was , once again, rescheduled for 12.10.2011. 8.2 At the hearing held on , 12.10.2011 , the CIC extended the time for implementation of its order by a period of (40) days, at the request of the CPIO. The proceedings were posted for 1.12.2011. 8.3 By a notice dated 29.11.2011 , the said proceedings , were rescheduled for 30.12.2011. On 30.12.2011, the CIC passed the second impugned order , in view of non -compliance of its earlier order dated 15.6.2 011. By order dated 30.2.2011 , the CIC issued a show cause notice to the then PIO , as to why, penalty of Rs 25000 should not be imposed on him under Section 20(1) of the RTI Act , for failure to implement its order . A show cause notice was also issued t o the Secretary , Government of India, Ministry of Defence , as to why compensation to the tune of Rs 50 ,000/- should not be awarded to Co l. V.K. Shad , under the provisions of Section 19(8)(b) of the RTI Act , for failure to supply information , in compliance , with its orders. The personal WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 8 of 30 appearance of the two named officers alongwith their written representation , was also direct ed. The matter was posted for fur ther proceedings , on 7.2.2012. 8.4 It is in this background that writ petition 499/2012 , was mo ved in this court , on 24.01.2012 when , the impugned order s in so far as it directed provision of the opinion of the JAG branch , was stayed . WP(C) No. 1138/2012 9. In this case a Court Of Inquiry was ordered by the Head Quarter Central Command , to inve stigate circumstances in which , one (1) rifle 5.56 mm INSAS alongwith one (1) magazine and 40 (forty) cartridges , SAS 5.56 mm Ball INSAS , from 40 Company ASC (Sup) Type 'D', was lost on the night of 14/15 January, 2006 and thereafter, recovered on 18.01.20 06. 9.1 On the conclusion of the Court Of Inquiry , the proceedings , the findings as also the recommendations as in the first case , were finally placed before the GOC -in-Chief , Central Command , who came to the conclusion that administrative action was imperative against Col. P.P. Singh , for his failure to supervise the duties which were required to be performed b y his subordinates and , in ensuring , the safe custody of weapons , taken on charge , by his unit, contra ry to the provisions of para 37(c) of the Regulations For The Army 1987 (Revised) and para 193 of the Military Security Instructions, 2001. 9.2 Based on the directions of the GOC -in-Chief, a show cause notice was issued to Col. P.P. Singh , on 28.10.2006. After perusing the reply of C ol. P.P. Sin gh, and based on the record the GOC -in-Chief, Central Command directed that his severe displeasure (Recordable) be conveyed to Col. P.P. Singh. 9.3 It is in th is background that Col. P.P. Singh also took recourse to the RTI Act , and sought , the followin g information vide his application dated WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 9 of 30 29.1.2011 : "(a) Findings and opinion of the Court alongwith recommendations of the Cdrs in chain and dirn of the competent authority (GOC UB Area, GOC -in-C Cent ral Command) on the Court Of Inquiry convened under S tn. SQs Cell, Meerut convening order no. 124901/4/G dt 21 Jan 2006. (b) Noting sheets relating to processing this case at HQ UB Area and HQ Central Command based on which GOC -in-C awarded me Severe Displeasure (Recordable) . In this connection refer dirn issued HQ Central Command letter no. 190105/653/U/DV dt. 10 feb 2007. (c) Please provide copy of the authority under which this Court Of Inquiry was forwarded to HQ UB Area and further on to HQ Central Command whereas the convening authority of the Court Of Inquiry was St. HQ Cell Meerut." 9.4 By communication dated 21. 2.2011 , the PIO rejected the application of Col. P.P. Singh by taking recourse to the provisions of Section 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act. 9.5 Being aggrieved , Col. P.P. Singh preferred an appea l with the first appellate authority. Interestingly, the first appellate authority while agreeing with the conclusions of the PIO observed that the PIO had “correctly disposed ” of Col. P.P. Singh application a s it fell squarely under the exceptions provid ed in Section 8(1) (g) & (h) of the RTI Act. It may be pertinent to point out that the PIO had in fact taken recourse to provisi ons of Section 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act. 9.6 Col. P.P. Singh preferred an appeal with the CIC. The CIC , while taking note of t he fact that no proceedings were pending against Col. P.P. Singh , directed the release of information sought by him based on the reasoning provided in its order passed in Col. V.K. Shad 's case, though after redacting the names and designations of the offic ers, who had made notings in the file s, in accordance with the provisions of Section 10(1) of the RTI Act. The petitioners were directed to furnish the information , as directed, within WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 10 of 30 four (4) weeks of the order. 9.7 As noticed above, though Col. P.P. Singh 's appeal before the CIC was disposed on 4.5.2011 , it got listed again on 5.1.2012, on which date thirty (30) days were sought on behalf of the petitioners , to comply with the order of the CIC. WP(C) No. 1144/2012 10. On 5.12. 2009 , a Court Of Inquiry was ordered by the Head Quarters Western Command to investigate the alleged irregularit ies, in the procurement of shoes , as part of personal kit store s item for Indian troops , proceeding s on a United Nation's assignment , during the period January, 2006 till the date of issuance of the convening order. 10.1 The Court Of Inquiry , evidently , found Brig. S. Sabharwal guilty of certain lapses alongwith four officers of the Ordinance Services Directorate, Integrated Head Quarters, Ministry of Defence. Brig. S. Sabharwal 's conduct was found blameworthy , in so far as , he had omitted to obtain formal written sanction of the Major General of the Ordinance prior to issuing orders to carry out a major amendment vis-a-vis the scope and composition of the board of of ficers, who were involved in the short -listing of eligible firms ; and for omitting to comply with instructions , which required him to nominate a n officer of the rank of brigadier who belonged to a Branch other than the Ordinance Branch, for inclusion in th e price negotiation committee. It appears that Brig. S. Sabharwal had , contrary to the stipulated norms, nominated instead an officer of the rank of Major General attached to the Ordinance Services Directorate . 10.2 Based on the findings of the Court Of Inquiry , a show cause notice was issued to Brig. S. Sabharwal , on 10.04.2010 , by the Head Quarters Western Command . Brig. S. Sabharwal , replied to the show cause notice vide communication dated 20.05.2010. However, by a communication dated WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 11 of 30 14.6.2010 , Brig. S. Sabharwal called upon the concerned authority to defer its decision on the show cause notice , till such time it had sought clarification s from officers named in the said communication with regard to his assertion that he had been issued verbal inst ructions with regard to the matter under consideration. 10.3 On 18.6.2010 , Brig. S. Sabharwal wrote to the authority concern ed that since , he was one of the last witnesses summoned for cross -examination by the Court Of Inquiry , he was not able to present his case effectively . In these circumstances, he requested the convening authority to accord permission to cross -examine the witnesses in his defence , so that he could bring out the facts of the case in their correct perspective. 10.4 Evidently, a day prior to the aforesaid request, i.e., on 17.6.2010 , the GOC -in-Chief, after considering the recommendations of the Court Of Inquiry , the contents of the show cause notice and the reply of Brig. S. Sabharwal , directed that his severe displeasure (recordabl e), be conveyed to Brig. S. Sabharwal . 10.5 This resulted in Brig. S. Sabharwal approaching the PIO with an application under the RTI Act. Th e application was preferred with the PIO , on 3.12.2010. Brig. S. Sabharwal sought the following information: "(a) All notings and correspondence of case file No. 0337/UN/PERS KIT STORES/DV2 of HQ Western Command. (b) Action taken Notings initiated by HQ Western Comd (DV) on HQ 335 Msl Bde Sig No. A -0183 dt 14 Jun 10 (Copy encl). " 10.6 The PIO, however, vide communication dated 10.12.2010 , denied the information by relying upon the provisions of Section 8(4)(e) and (h) [sic 8(1)(e) and (h)] of the RTI Act. It was the opinion of the PIO that , noting s and correspondence on the subject including legal opinions g enerated in the WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 12 of 30 case could not be given to Brig. S. Sabharwal in view of a " fiduciary relationship existing in the chain of command and staff processing the case". It was also observed by the PIO that the noting s and content s of the classified files were exempt from disclosure under the provisions of the Department of Personnel and Training (in short DoPT) letter n o. 1/20/2009 - IR dated 23.6.2009, and that , no public interest would be served in disclosing the information sought for other than the applicant' s own interest. 10.7 Being aggrieved , Brig. S. Sabharwal filed an appeal with the first appellate authority , on 12.1.2011. The first appellate authority rejected the appeal , which was conveyed under the cover of the letter dated 11.2.2011 . To be noted , that even though , the letter dated 11.2.2011 is on record, the order of the first appellate authority has not been placed on record by the petitioner s herein. 11. Brig. S. Sabharwal , being dissatisfied with result, filed a second appeal with the CIC. The CIC , passed a similar order , as was passed in the other two cases, whereby it directed that copy of file notings be supplied to Brig. S. Sabharwal after redacting the names and designations of the officers, who made the notings , in accordance with , the provisions of Section 10(1) of the RTI Act. SUBMISSIONS OF COUNSELS 12. In the background of the aforesaid facts, it has been argued by Mr Mehra, learned ASG , that the CIC in several cases , contrary to the decision in V.K. Shad's case, ha s taken the view that the file notings , which include legal opinions, need not be disclosed , as it may affect the outcome of the legal action instituted by the applicant/querist seeking the information. Before me, however, reference was made to the case of Col. A.B. Narg olkar vs Ministry of Defence passed in appeal no. CIC/LS/A/2009/000951 dated 22.9.2009 . 12.1 It was thus the submission of the learned ASG that, in the impugned WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 13 of 30 order s, a contrary view has been taken to that which was taken in Col. A.B. Nargolkar’s case. This, he submitted was not permissible as it was a bench of co -equal strength. It was submitted that in case the CIC disagreed with the view taken earlier, it ought to have referred the matter to a larger Bench. 12.2 Apart from the above, Mr Mehra has submitted that, the petitioner's action of denying information, which pertains to file notings and opinion of the JAG branch is sustainable under Section 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act. It was contended that there was a fiduciary relationship between the off icers in the chain of command , and those , who were placed in the higher echelon s, of what was essentially a pyramid ical structure. In arriving at a final decision, the GOC -in-Chief takes into account several inputs , which includes , the notings on file as well as the opinion of the JAG branch. It was submitted that since , the JAG branch has a duty to act and give ad vice on matters falling within the ambit of its mandate, the disclosure of information would result in a breach of a fiduciary relationship qua those who give the advi ce and the final decision making authority, which is the recipient of the advi ce. 12.3 Mr Mehra submitted that , in all three cases, the advi ce rendered by the JAG branch was taken into account both while initiating proceedings an d also at the stage of imposition of punishment against the delinquent officers. 12.4 Though it was not argued , in the grounds , in one of the writ petition s, reliance is also placed on Army Rule, 184, to contend that only the copy of the statements and documents relied upon during the conduct of Court Of Inquiry are to be provided to the delinquent officers. It is contended that the directions contained in the impugned order s of the CIC , are contrary to the said Rule . 12.5 In order to buttress his submission s reliance was placed by Mr Mehra , on the observations of the Supreme Court , in the case of Central Board of Secondary Education & Ors. vs Aditya Bandopadhayay & Ors. (2011) 8 WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 14 of 30 SCC 497 . A particular stress , was laid on the observations made in paragraphs 38, 39, 44 , 45 and 63 of the said judgment . 13. On the other hand, the respondents in the captioned writ petitions, who were led by Col. V.K. Shad, contended to the contrary and relied upon the impugned order s of the CIC. Specific reliance was placed on the judgments of this court , in the case of , Maj. General Surender Kumar Sahni vs UOI & Ors in CW No. 415/2003 dated 09.04.2003 and The CPIO, Supreme Court of India vs Subhash Chandra Agarwal & Anr. WP(C) 288/2009 pronounced on 02.09.2009 ; and th e judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of CBSE vs A ditya Bandopadhayay . REASONS 14. I have heard the learned ASG and the respondents in the writ petitions. As indicated at the very outset, the issue has been narrowed down to whether or not the fil e notings and the opinion of the JAG branch fall within the provisions of Section 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act. I may only note , even though the authorities below have fleetingly adverted to the provisions of Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act, the said aspect was neither pressed nor argued before me, by the learned ASG. The emphasis was only qua the provisions of Section 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act. The defence qua non-disclosure of information set up by the pet itioner s is thus , based on , what is perceived by them a s subsistence of a fiduciary relation ship between officers who generate the note s and the opinions which , presumably were taken in account by the final decision making authority , in coming to the con clusion which it did , with regard to the guilt of the del inquent officers and the extent of punishment , which was accorded in each case. 15. In order to answer the issue in the present case , fortunately I am not required to, in a sense, re-invent the wheel. The Supreme Court in two recent judgments has dealt with the contours of what would constitute a fiduciary WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 15 of 30 relationship. 15.1 Out of the two cases, the first case, was cited before me, which is CBSE vs Aditya Bandopadhaya y and the other being ICAI vs Suaunak H. Satya and Ors. (2011) 8 SCC 781 . 15.2 Before I proceed further, as has been often repeated in judgment after judgments the preamble of the RTI Act , sets forth the guideline for appreciating the scope and ambit of the provisions contained in the said Act. The preamble , thus envi sages , a practica l regime of right to information for citizens , so that they have access to information which is in control of public authorities with the object of promoting transp arency and accountability in the working of every such public authority. This right of the citizenry is required to be balanced with other public interest including efficient operations of the government, optimum use of limited physical resources and the preservation of confidentiality of sensitive information. The idea being to weed out corru ption , and to hold , the government and their instrumentalities accountable to the governed. 15.3 The RTI Act is , thus, divided into six chapters and two schedules. For our purpose , what is important , is to advert to , certain provisions in chapter I, II and VI of the RTI Act. 15.4 Keeping the above in mind, what is thus, required to be ascertained is: (i) whether the material with respect to which access is sought , is firstly , information within the meaning of the RTI Act ? (ii) whether the information sought is from a public authority, which is amenable to the provisions of the RTI Act ? (iii) whether the material to which access is sought (provided it is information within the meaning of the RTI Act and is in possession of an authority which comes with in the me aning of the term public authority ) falls within the exclusionary provisions contained in Section 8 (1)(e) of the RTI Act? WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 16 of 30 15.5 In order to appreciat e the width and scope of the aforementioned provision , one would also have to bear in mind the prov isions of Sections 9, 10, 11 & 22 of the RTI Act. 16. In the present case, therefore, let me first examine whether file notings and opinion of the JAG branch would fall within the ambit of the provisions of the RTI Act . 16.1 Section 2(f) , inter alia de fines infor mation to mean “any” “material” contained in any form including record s, documents, memo, emails, opinions , advises , press releases, circulars, orders, log books, contracts, reports, papers, samples, models, data material held in any electronic form and information relating to any private body , which can be , accessed by a public authority under any other law for the time being in force. Section 2(i) defines record as one which includes - any document, manuscript and f ile; (ii) any microfi lm and fac simile copy of a document ; (iii) reproduction of image or images embodie d in such microfilm ; and (iv) any other material produced by a computer or any other devi ce. 16.2 A conjoint reading of Section 2(f) and 2(i) leaves no doubt in my mind that it is an expansive definition even while it is inclusive which, brings within its ambit any material available in any form. There is an express reference to “opinions” and “advices”, in the definition of information under Section 2(f). While, the definition of record in Section 2(i) includes a “file”. 16.3 Having regard to the above, there can be no doubt that file notings and opinions of the JAG branch are information , to which , a person taking recourse to the RTI Act can have access provided it is availab le with the concerned public authority. 16.4 Section 2(h) of the RTI Act defines a public authority to mean any authority or body or institution of Central Government established or constituted , inter alia , by or under , the Constitution or by or under a law made WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 17 of 30 by Parliament . There can be no doubt nor, can it be argued that the Indian Army is not a public authority within the meaning of the RTI Act; which has the Ministry of Defence of the Government of India as its administrative ministry 16.5 The sc ope and ambit of the right to the information to which access may be had from a public authority is defined in Section 2(j) . Section 2(j) , inter alia , gives the right to information , which is access ible under this Act and, is held by or , is in control of the public authority by seeking inspection of work, documents, records by taking notes, extracts of certified copy of documents on record, by taking certified copy of material and also obtaining information in the form of discs, floppy, tapes, video casset es, which is , available in any other electronic mode, whether stored in the compu ter or any other devi ce. 16.6 Therefore, infor mation which is available in the records of the Indian Army and, records as indicated hereinabove includes files , is informati on to which the respondents are entitled to gain access. The question is : which is really the heart of the matter, as to whether the information sought , in the present case, falls in the exclusionary (1)(e) of Section 8 of the RTI Act . 16.7 It may be im portant to note that Section 3 of the RTI Act , is an omnibus provision, in a sense , it mandates that all citizens shall have right to information subject to the other provisions of the RTI Act. Therefore, unless the information is specifically excluded , it is required to be provide d in the form in which it is available, unless : (i) it would disproportionately divert the resources of public authority or , (ii) would be detrimental to the safety and preservation of the record in question [See Section 7(9)] or, the provision of information so ught would invo lve an infringement of copy right subsisting in a person other than the State (see Section 9) . 16.8 One may also be faced with a situation where information sought is WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 18 of 30 dovetailed with information which thoug h falls within the exclusionary provisions referred to above, is severable. In such a situation, recourse can be taken to Section 10 of the RTI Act, which provides for severing that part of the information which is exemp t from disclosure under the RTI Act, provided it can be “reasonably ” severed from that which is not exempt. In other words, information which is not exempted but is otherwise reasonably severable, can be given access to a person making a request for grant of access to the same. 16.9 Section 11 deals with a situatio n where infor mation available with a public authority which relates to or has been supplied by a third party, and is treated as confidential by that third party . In such an eventuality the PIO of the public authority is requi red to give notice to such third party of the request received for disclosure of information , and thereby , invite the said third party to make a submission in writing or orally , whether the information should be disclosed or not. In coming to a conclusio n either way, the submissions made by the third party , will have to be kept in mind while taking a decision with regard to disclosure of information. 17. The last Section , which is relevant for our purpose, is Section 22. The said Section conve ys in no uncertain terms the width of the RTI Act . It is a non-obstante clause which proclaims that the RTI Act shall prevail notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in the Official Secrets Act, 1923 or any other law for the time being in force or , in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than the RTI Act. In other words, it overrides every other act or instrument having the effect of law including the Official Secret s Act, 1923 . 17.1 Thus , an over-view of the Act would show that it ma ndates a public authority , which holds or has control over any information to disclose the same to a citizen , when approached , without the citizen having to give any reasons for seeking a disclosure. And in pursuit of this goal, the seeker of WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 19 of 30 information , apart from giv ing his contact details for the purposes of dispatch of information, is exempted from disclosing his personal details [see Section 6(2)]. 17.2 Therefore, the rule is that, if the public authority has access to any material , which is infor mation , within the meaning of the RTI Act and the said information is in its possession and/or its control, the said information would have to be disseminated to the information seeker , i.e., the citizen of this country, without him having to give reasons or his personal details except to the extent relevant for transmi tting the information. 17.3 As indicated ab ove, notes on files and opinions, to my mind, fall within the ambit of the provisions of the RTI Act. The possessor of information being a public authority , i.e., the Indian Army it could only deny the information , to the seeker of information who are respondents in the present case, only if the information sought falls within the exceptions provided in Section 8 of the RTI Act ; in the instant case protection is claimed under clause (1)(e) of Section 8 . Therefore, the argument of the petitioners that the information can be denied under Army Rule, 184 or the DoPT instructions dated 23.06.2009 are completely untenable in view of the over -riding effec t of the provisions of the RTI Act. Both the Rule and the DoPT instructions have to give way to the provisions of Section 22 of the RTI Act. The reason being that , they were in existence when the RTI Act was enacted by the Parliament and the legislature is presumed to have knowledge of exi sting legislation including sub ordinate legislation . The Rule and the instruction can, in this case , at best have the flavour of a subordinate legislat ion. The said subordinate legislat ion cannot be taken recourse to, in my opinion to nullify the provisions of the RTI Act. 17.4 Therefore, one would have to examine the provisions of Section 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act. The relevant parts of the said Section read as under: WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 20 of 30 "8. Exemption from disclosure of information – (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen - xxxx xxxx xxxx (e) information available to a person in his fiduciary relationship, unless the competent authority is satisfied that the larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information. xxxx xxxx Provided that the i nformation , which cannot be denied to the Parliament or State Legislature shall not be denied to any person. (2) Notwithstanding anything in the Official Secrets Act, 1923 (19 of 1923) nor any of the exemptions permissible in accordance with sub -section (1) , a public authority may allow access to infor mation , if public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests. (3) x x x x x Provided that where any question arises as to the date from which the said period of twenty years has to be computed, the decision of the Central Government shall be final, subject to the usual appeals provided for in this Act." 17.5 In CBSE vs Aditya Bandopadhyay case, the Supreme Court was called upon to decide the issue as to whether , an examinee was entitled to an inspection of his answer books , in view of the appellant before the Supreme Court, i.e., the CBSE , claiming exemption under Section 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act. 17.6 In this context, the court considered the issue : whether the examining body holds the evaluated answer books in a fiduciary relationship with the examiners . 17.7 The Supreme Court after noting various meaning s ascribed to the term WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 21 of 30 “fiduciary ” in various dictionar ies and texts , summed up what the term fiduciary would mean , in the following paragraph of its judgment : “……39. The term 'fiduciary' refers to a person having a duty to act for the benefit of another, showing good faith and condour, where such other person reposes trust and special confidence in the person owing or discharging the duty. The term 'fiduciary relationship' is used to describe a situation or transaction where one person (beneficiary) places complete confidence in another person (fiduciary) in regard to his affairs, business or transaction/s. The term also refers to a person who holds a thing in trust for another (beneficiary). The fiduciary is expected to act in confidence and for the benefit and advantage of the beneficiary, an d use good faith and fairness in dealing with the beneficiary or the things belonging to the beneficiary. If the beneficiary has entrusted anything to the fiduciary, to hold the thing in trust or to execute certain acts in regard to or with reference to th e entrusted thing, the fiduciary has to act in confidence and expected not to disclose the thing or information to any third party ….” 17.8 Examples of certain relationships , where both parties act in a fiduciary capacity , while treating the other as ben eficiary , are set out in paragraph 40 and 41 of the judgment. In paragraph 41 onwards the Court examined what would be the true scope of the expression "information available to a person in his capacity as fiduciary relationship" , as used in Section 8(1)( e) of the RTI Act. In that context several fiduciary relationships were referred to like the one between a trustee and a beneficiary of a trust ; a guardian with reference to a minor or , a physically infirm or mentally incapa citated person ; a parent with r eference to a child ; a lawyer or a chartered accountant with reference to a client etc. After considering the matter at length, t he Supreme Court came to the conclusion that there was no fiduciary relationship between the examining body and the exami ner with reference to evaluated answer books . The court also examined the issue that if one were to assume that there was a WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 22 of 30 fiduciary relationship between the examiner and the exa mining body , whether the exemption would operate vis-a-vis third part ies. In paragraph 44 of the judgment, the court concluded that if there was a fiduciary relationship, the exemption would operate vis -a-vis a third party, however, there would be no question of withholding information relating to the beneficiary from the beneficiar y himself. 17.9 In paragraph s 49 and 50 , the court concluded that since the examiner is acting as an agent of the examining body, in principle, the examining body is not in the position of a fiduciary , with reference to the examiner. On the other hand, once the examin er hand s over the custody of the evaluated answer books, whose contents he is barred from disclosing as he acts as a fiduciary , uptill that point of time, ceases to be in that relationship once the work of evaluation of answer books is concl uded, and the evaluated answer sheets are handed over to the examining body. In other words, since the examiner does not have any copyright or proprie tary right or a right of confidentiality, in the evaluated answer books, the examining body cannot be sai d to be holding the evaluated answer books in a fiduci ary relationship qua the examine r. 18. A similar view was held by the same Bench of the Supreme Court in the case of ICAI vs Shaunak H. Satya . The Supreme Court , while dealing with the issue whether the instructions and solutions to questions are information available to examiner and moderators in their fiduciary capacity , and therefore , exempt under Section 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act, made the following observations in paragraph 22 of the judgment: "....22. It should be noted that Section 8(1)(e) uses the words "information available to a person in his fiduciary relationship. Significantly Section 8(1)(e) does not use the words "information available to a public authority in its fiduciary relationship" . The use of the words "person" shows that the holder of the information in a fiduciary relationship need not only be a 'public authority' as the WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 23 of 30 word 'person' is of much wider import than the word 'public authority'. Therefore the exemption under Section 8(1)(e) is available not only in regard to information that is held by a public authority (in this case the examining body) in a fiduciary capacity, but also to any information that is given or made available by a public authority to anyone else for being held in a fiduciary relationship. In other words, anything given and taken in confidence expecting confidentiality to be maintained will be information available to a person in fiduciary relationship. As a consequence, it has to be held that the instructio ns and solutions to questions communicated by the examining body to the examiners, head -examiners and moderators, are information available to such persons in their fiduciary relationship and therefore exempted from disclosure under Section 8(1)(d) of RTI Act...." 19. The court also made clear in paragraph 26 of the judgment that there were ten categories of information which were exemp t from Section 8 of the RTI Act. Out of the ten categories, six categories enjoyed absolute exemption. These being: those information , which fell in clauses (a), (b), (c), (f), (g) & (h) of Section 8 (1) of the RTI Act, while information enumerated in clauses (d), (e) & (j) of the very same Section enjoyed “conditional ” exemption to the extent that the information was subje ct to over -riding power of the competent authority under the RTI Act in larger public interest, which could in a given case, direct disclosure of such information. Clause (i), the Supreme Court noted, was period specific in as much as under Sub-Section (3) such information could be provided if the event or matter in issue had occurred 20 years prior to the date of the request being made under Section 6 of the RTI Act. It inter alia concluded , that, information relating to fiduciary relationship under cla use 8(1)(e) did not enjoy absolute exemption. 20. Before I proceed further, I may also note that the first proviso in Section 8 says that, information which cannot be denied to the Parliament or the State Legislature , shall not be denied to any person. Subsection (2) of WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 24 of 30 Section 8 , states that notwithstanding anything contained in the Official Secret Act s, 1923, or any of the exemption s provided in Subsection (1) , would not come in the way of a public authority in allow ing access to information if , publi c interest in its disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interest. 20.1 A Full Bench of this court in the case of Secretary General, Supreme Court of India Vs. Subhash Chandra Agarwal, 166 (2010) DLT 305 , in the context of provisions of Section 8 (1)(j) also examined what would constitute a fiduciary relationship. The observations contained in paragraph 97 to 101 , being apposite are extracted hereinbelow: ".....97. As Waker defines it: "A "fiduciary" is a person in a position of trust, or occupyi ng a position of power and confidence with respect to another such that he is obliged by various rules of law to act solely in the interest of the other, whose rights he has to protect. He may not make any profit or advantage from the relationship without full disclosure. The category includes trustees, Company promoters and directors, guardians, solicitors and clients and other similarly placed." [Oxford Companion to Law, 1980 p.469] 98. "A fiduciary relationship", as observed by Anantnarayanan, J., "may a rise in the context of a jural relationship. Where confidence is reposed by one in another and that leads to a transaction in which there is a conflict of interest and duty in the person in whom such confidence is reposed, fiduciary relationship immediatel y springs into existence." [see Mrs. Nellie Wapshare v. Pierce Lasha & Co. Ltd. AIR 1960 Mad 410] 99. In Lyell v. Kennedy (1889) 14 AC 437, the Court explained that whenever two persons stand in such a situation that confidence is necessarily reposed by on e in the other, there arises a presumption as to fiduciary relationship which grows naturally out of that WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 25 of 30 confidence. Such a confidential situation may arise from a contract or by some gratuitous undertaking, or it may be upon previous request or undertake n without any authority. 100. In Dale & Carrington Invt. (P) Ltd. v. P.K. Prathaphan: (2005) 1 SCC 212 and Needle Industries (India) Ltd. v. Needle Industries Newey (India) Holding Ltd. (1981) 3 SCC 333, the Court held that the directors of the company owe fiduciary duty to its shareholders. In P.V. Sankara Kurup v. Leelavathy Nambier: (1994) 6 SCC 68, the Court held that an agent and power of attorney can be said to owe a fiduciary relationship to the principal. 101. Section 88 of the Indian Trusts Act req uires a fiduciary not to gain an advantage of his position. Section 88 applies to a trustee, executor, partner, agent, director of a company, legal advisor or other persons bound in fiduciary capacity. Kinds of persons bound by fiduciary character are enum erated in Mr. M. Gandhi's book on "Equity, Trusts and Specific Relief" (2nd ed., Eastern Book Company) (1) Trustee, (2) Director of a company, (3) Partner, (4) Agent, (5) Executor, (6) Legal Adviser, (7) Manager of a joint family, (8) Parent and child, (9) Religious, medical and other advisers, (10) Guardian and Ward, (11) Licensees appointed on remuneration to purchase stocks on behalf of government, (12) Confidential Transactions wherein confidence is reposed, and which are indicated by (a) Undue influenc e, (b) Control over property, (c) Cases of unjust enrichment, (d) Confidential information, (e) Commitment of job, (13) Tenant for life, WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 26 of 30 (14) Co -owner, (15) Mortgagee, (16) Other qualified owners of property, (17) De facto guardian, (18) Receiver, (19) Ins urance Company, (20) Trustee de son tort, (21) Co -heir, (22) Benamidar. 20.2 The above would show that there are two kinds of relationship s. One , where a fiducial relationship exist s, which is applicable to legal relationship s between parties , such as gu ardian and ward , administrator and heirs, executors and beneficiaries of a testamentary succession; while the other springs from a confidential relationship which is pivoted on confidence. In other words confidence is reposed and exercised. Thus , the te rm fiduciary applies, it appe ars, to a person who enjoys peculiar confidence qua other persons . The relationship mandates fair dealing and good faith , not necessarily borne out of a legal obligation . It also permeates to transactions , which are informal in nat ure. [See words and phrases Permanent Edn. (Vol. 16-A, p. 41) and para 38.3 of the CBSE vs Aditya Bandopadhyay ]. As indicated above, the Supreme C ourt in the very same judgment in paragraph 39 has summed up as to what the term fiduciary wo uld mean. 20.3 In the instant case, what is sought to be argued in sum and substance that, it is a fiducial relation of the latter kind , where the persons generating the note or opinion expect s the fiduciary, i.e., the institution, which is the Army, to hold thei r trust and confidence and not disclose the information to the respondents herein, i.e., Messers V.K. Shad and Ors. If this argumen t were to be accepted, then the persons , who generate the notes in the file or the opinions, would have to be , in one sense , the beneficiaries of the said information. In an institutional set up , it can hardly be argued that notes on WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 27 of 30 file qua a personnel or an employee of an institution, such as the Army, whether vis-a-vis his performance or his conduct , in any manner , can benefit the person, who generates the note or renders an opinion. As a matter of fact, the person who generates the note or renders an opinion is presumed to be a person who is objective and not conflict ed by virtue of his interest in the matter, on which , he is called upon to deliberate. If that position holds, then it can neither be argued nor can it be conceived that notes on file or opinions rendered in an institutional setup by one officer qua the working or con duct of another officer bring s forth a fid uciary relationship. It is also not a relationship of the kind where both parties required the other to act in a fiduciary capacity by treating the other as a beneficiary. The examples of such situations are found say in a partnership firm where , each partner acts in fiduciary capacity qua the other partner(s). 20.4 If at all, a fiduciary relationship springs up in such like situation , it would be when a third party seeks information qua the performance or conduct of an employee. The institution, in such a case , which holds the information , would then have to determine as to whether such information ought to be revealed keeping in mind the competing public interest. If public interest so demands, information, even in such a situation , would have to b e disclosed, though after taking into account the rights of the individual concern ed to whom the information pertains. A denial of access to such information to the information seeker s, i.e., the respondents herein, ( Messers V.K. Shad & Co.) e specially in the circumstances that the said information is used admittedly in coming to the conclusion that the delinquent officers were guilty , and in determining the punishment to be accorded to them , would involve a serious breach of principles of natural justice , as non - communication would entail civil consequences and would render such a decision vulnerable to challenge under Article 14 of the Constitution of India WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 28 of 30 provided information is sought and was not given . [See UOI vs R.S. Khan 173 (2010) DLT 680 ]. 21. It is trite law that the right to information is a constitutional right under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India which , with the enactment of the RTI Act has been given in addition a statutory flavour with the exceptions provided therein. But fo r the exceptions given in the RTI Act ; the said statute recognizes the right of a citizen to seek access to any material which is held or is in possession of public authority. 22. This brings me to the first proviso of Section 8(1) , which categorically states that no information will be denied to any person, which cannot be denied to the Parliament or the State L egislat ure. Simila rly, sub -section (2) of Section 8 , empowers the public authority to over -ride the Official Secrets Act, 1923 and , the exemption s contained in sub -section (1) of Section 8 , of the RTI Act, if public interest in the disclosure of information outweighs the harm to the protected interest. As indicated hereinabove, the Supreme Court in CBSE vs Aditya Bandopadhayay case has clearly ob served that exemption under Section 8(1)(e) is conditional and not an absolute exemption . 23 I may only add a note of caution here: which is, that protection afforded to a client vis-à-vis his legal advises under the provisions of Section 126 to 129 of th e Evidence Act, 1872 is not to be confused with the present situation. The protection under the said provisions is accorded to a client with respect to his communication with his legal advisor made in confidence in the course of and for the purpose of his employment unless the client consents to its disclosure or, it is a communication made in furtherance of any illegal purpose. The institution i.e The Indian Army in the present case cannot by any stretch of imagination be categorized as a client. The legal professional privilege extends only to a barrister, pleader, attorney or Vakil. The persons who have generated opinions and/or the notings on the file in the present case WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 29 of 30 do not fall in any of these categories. 23.1 Having regard to the above, I am of the view that the contentions of the petitioners that the information sought by the respondents (Messers V.K. Shad & Co. ) under Se ction 8(1)(e) of the Act is exempt from disclosure, is a contention, which is misconceived and untenable. For instance, can the information in issue in the present case, denied to the Parliament and State Legislature. In my view it cannot be denied, therefore, the necessary consequences of providing information to Messers V.K. Shad should follow. 24. The argument of the learned AS G that , the CIC had taken a diametrically opposite view in the other cases and hence the CIC ought to have referred the matter to a larger bench , does have weight. This objection ordinarily may have weighed with m e but for the following reasons :- 24.1 First, the judgment of the CIC cited for this purpose i.e., Col. A.B. Nargolkar case, dealt with the situation where an order of remand was passed directing the PIO to apply the ratio of the judgment of a Single Judge of this court in the case of the CPIO, S upreme Court of India Vs. Subhash Chandra Agarwal and Anr., WP (C) 288/2009, pronounced on 02.09.200 9. The CIC by itself did render a definite view. 24.2 Second, keeping in mind the fact that the information commissioner s administ ering the RTI Act are neither persons who are necessarily instructed in law , i.e., are not trained lawyers , and nor did they have the benefit of such guidance at the stage of argument, I do not think it would be appropriate to set aside the impugned judgment on this ground and rem and the matt er for a fresh consideration by a larger bench of the CIC. This view, I am inclined to hold also, on account of the fact that , since then there have been several rulings of various High Courts including that of the Supreme Court, to which I have made a reference above, and that , remanding the matter to the CIC would only delay the cause of the parties before me. WP(C) 499, 1138 & 1144/201 2 Page 30 of 30 24.3 These are cases which affect the interest of both parties, especially the petitioner s in a large number of cases , and therefore , the need for a ruling of a superior court one way or the other , on the issue. It is in this context that I had proceeded to decide the matter on merits , and not take the route of remand in this particular case. The CIC is, however, advised in future t o have regard to the discipline of referring the matters to a larger bench where a bench of co-ordinate strength take s a view which is not consistent with the view of the other. 25. For the foregoing reasons, the writ petitions are dismissed. The impugn ed orders passed by the CIC are sustained. T he information sought by Messer s V.K. Shad and Ors will be supplied within two weeks from today , in terms of the orders passed by the CIC . However, having regard to the peculiar facts and circumst ances of the ca se, parties are directed to bear their own costs save and except to the extent that the sum of Rs 5000/ - each, deposited pursuant to the two order s of my predecessor of even date , passed on 27.02.2012 , in WP(C) Nos. 1144/2012 and 1138/2012 , shall be releas ed, on a pro rata basis , to the three respondents , towards incidental expenses.

JUSTICE RAJIV SAHAI ENDLAW RAJIV SAHAI ENDLAW , J. 1. This intra court appeal impugns the order dated 22nd December, 201 0 of the learned Single Judge dismissing in limin e WP(C) No. 8558/2010 preferred by the appellant. The said writ petition was preferred impugning the decision dated 12th November, 2010 of the Central Information Commission (CIC) directing the appellant to furnish to the respondent the information sought by the respondent. Notice of this appeal and of the application for condonation of 106 days delay in filing th is appeal was issued vide order dated 26th May, 2011 and the operation of the order dated 22nd December, 2010 of the learned Single Judge was also stayed. The LPA No.487/2011 Page 2 of 19 respondent remained unserved with the report that “a lady at the address of the respondent refused to accept the notice on the ground that the respondent was working at “Jabwa ” and she had no knowledge of the notice”. The respondent was directed to be served afresh but no steps were taken by the appellant. When the matter came up before us on 1st March, 2012, being of the view that the matter was fully covered by the judgment of the Supreme Court in The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India v. Shaunak H. Satya (2011) 8 SCC 781, the counsel for the appellant was asked to satisfy this Court as to the merit of this appeal. The counsel for the appellant sought adjournment from time to time and in these circumstances on 30th March, 2012 orders were reserved in the appeal with liberty to the counsel for the appellant to file written arguments. Written arguments dated 11th April, 2012 have been filed by the appellant and which have been consid ered by us. 2. The respondent in his application dated 5th April, 2010 had sought the following information from the Information Officer of the appellant. “1. Certified copies of original questions papers of all Mch super - speciality entrance exam conducted from 2005 -2010. LPA No.487/2011 Page 3 of 19 2. Certified copies of correct answers of all respective questions asked in Mch super -speciality entrance exam conducted from 2005 -2010. ” 3. The Information Officer of the appellant vide reply dated 21st April, 2010 refused to supply the information sought on the ground that the “questions and their answers are prepared and edited by AIIMS , thus the product remains „intellectual property ‟ of AIIMS. Since these questions are part of the question bank and likely to be used again, the supply of question booklet would be against larger public interest”. The provisions of Section 8 (1) (d) and 8(1) (e) of the Right to Information Act, 2005 were also invoked. 4. The respondent preferred an appeal to the First Appellate Authority. The First App ellate Authority sought the comments of the appellant AIIMS. AIIMS , besides reiterating what was replied by its Information Officer added that the information asked was a part of confidential documents which compromises the process of selection and thus co uld not be disclosed. Though the order of the First Appellate Authority is not found in the paper book, but it appears that the appeal was dismissed as the respondent preferred a second appeal to the CIC. LPA No.487/2011 Page 4 of 19 5. It was the contention of the appellant before t he CIC that there are limited number of questions available with regard to super -speciality subjects in the question bank and that the disclosure of such questions would only encourage the students appearing for the exam to simply memorize the answers for the exam, thereby adversely affecting the selection of good candidates for super -speciality courses. It was thus argued that the question papers of the entrance examination for super -speciality courses could not be made public. 6. CIC vide its order dated 12th November, 2010 (supra) , noticing the admission of the appellant that the question papers could not be termed as „intellectual property ‟ and observing that the appellant had been unable to invoke any exemption sub -clause of Section 8(1) of the Act to deny information and further holding that the refusal of information was not tenable under the Act, allowed the appeal of the respondent and directed the appellant to provide complete information to the respondent. 7. The learned Single Judge, as aforesaid dismiss ed the writ petition of the appellant challenging the aforesaid order of CIC in limin e observing that the appellant had not been able to show how the disclosure of the entrance LPA No.487/2011 Page 5 of 19 exam question papers would adversely affect the competitive position of any third party and thus Section 8(1)( d) was not attracted. It was further observed that there was no fiduciary relationship between the experts who helped to develop the question bank and the appellant and thus Section 8(1) (e) also could not be attract ed. 8. The appellant in its written submission s before us urges: i. that the subject matter of this appeal is not covered by the judgment of the Supreme Court in Shaunak H. Satya (supra) as the facts and circumstances are completely different; ii. that the entrance examination for super -speciality courses was introduced by the appellant only in the year 2005; iii. that at the level of super -speciality examination s, there can be very limited questions , which are developed gradually; that such question papers are not in public domain; that a declaration is also taken from the examinee appearing in the said examination that they will not copy the questions from the question papers or carry the same ; LPA No.487/2011 Page 6 of 19 iv. per contra, in Shaunak H. Satya (supra) the Institute of Chartered Accountants (ICA) was voluntarily publishing the suggested answers of the question papers in the form of a paper book and offering it for sale every year after examination and it was owing to the said peculiar fact that it was held that disclosure thereof would not harm the competitive position of any third party ; v. that the information seeker in Shaunak H. Satya (supra) was a candidate who had failed in examination and who was raising a question of corruption and accountability in the checking of question papers; per contra the respondent herein is neither a candidate nor has appeared in any of the super -speciality courses examination conducted by the appellant ; vi. that the appellant consults the subject experts, designs the question papers and t akes model answers in respect of each question papers ; such question papers prepared by experts in a particular manner for the appellant are original literary work and copyright in respect thereof vests in the appellant; LPA No.487/2011 Page 7 of 19 vii that the examinees taking the s aid examination are informed by a stipulation to the said effect on the admit card itself that civil and criminal proceedings will be instituted if found taking or attempting to take any part of the question booklets; viii. that copyright of appellant is p rotected under Section 8(1)(d); ix. that Section 9 of the Act also require s the Information Officer to reject a request for information, access whereto would involve an infringement of copyright subsisting in a person other than a State; x. that the appell ant also gives a declaration to the paper setters to protect their literary work - reliance in this regard is placed on Section 57 of the Copyright Act , 1957; xi. that at the stage of super -speciality , there can be very limited questions which can be frame d and if the question papers of all the examinations conducted from 2005 -2010 are disclosed, then all possible questions which can be asked would be in public LPA No.487/2011 Page 8 of 19 domain and that would affect the competitive position of students taking the examinations. 9. We have minutely considered the judgment of the Apex Court in Shaunak H. Satya (supra) in the light of the contentions aforesaid of the appellant and find - i. that the information seeker therein was an unsuccessful examinee of the examination qua which infor mation was sought; ii. that the ICA had pleaded confidentiality and invoked Section 8(1)(e) of the Act for denying the information as to “number of times the marks of any candidate or class of candidate s had been revised, the criteria used for the same, t he quantum of such revision and the authority which exercise d the said power to revise the mark s”; ii. that the CIC in that case had upheld the order refusing disclosure observing that the disclosure would seriously and irretrievably compromise the entire examination process and the instructions issued by the Examination Conducting P ublic Authority to its examiners are strictly confidential; LPA No.487/2011 Page 9 of 19 iii. it was also observed that the book annually prepared and sold by the ICA was providing „solution s‟ to the questions and not „model answers ‟; iv. however the High Court in that case had directed disclosure for the reason of the suggested answers being published and sold in open market by the ICA itself and there being thus no confidentiality with respect thereto. It was also held that the confidentiality disappeared when the result of the examination was declared. 10. The Supreme Court , on the aforesaid finding, held- i. that though the question papers were intellectual property of the ICA but the exemption under S ection 8(1)(d) is available only in regard to intellectual property disclosure of which would harm the competitive position of any third party; ii. that what may be exempted from disclosure at one point of time may cease to be exempted at a later point of time ; iii. that though the question papers and the solutions/model answers and instructions cannot be disclosed before the LPA No.487/2011 Page 10 of 19 examination but the disclosure , after the examination is held would not harm the competitive position of any third party inasmuch as the question paper is disclosed „to everyone ‟ at the time of examination and the ICA was itself publishing the suggested answers in the form of a book for sale every year, after the examination; iv. the word “State” used in Section 9 of the Act refers t o the Central Government or the State Government, Parliament or Legislature of a State or any local or other authority as described under Gazette of the Constitution; v. use of the expression “State” instead of “public authority ” showed that State includes even non -government organization s financed directly or indirectly by funds provided by the appropriate Government; vi. ICA being a „State ‟ was not entitled to claim protection against disclosure under Section 9. LPA No.487/2011 Page 11 of 19 vii. furnishing of information by an examin ing body, in response to a query under RTI Act, may not be termed as an infringement of copyright . The instructions and solutions to questions communicated by the examining body to the examiners, head examiners and moderators are information available to s uch persons in their fiduciary relationship and therefore exempted from disclosure under section 8(1)(d) of the Act and there is no larger public interest requiring denial of the statutory exemption regarding such information; viii. the competent authoriti es under the RTI Act have to maintain a proper balance so that while achieving transparency, the demand for information does not reach unmanageable proportions affecting other public interests, which include efficient operation of public authorities and go vernment, preservation of confidentiality of sensitive information and optimum use of limited fiscal resources. 11. The dissection aforesaid of the judgment Shaunak H. Satya in the light of the arguments of the appellant noted above do es show that the LPA No.487/2011 Page 12 of 19 learned Single Judge has not dealt therewith. We have satisfied ourselves from perusal of the writ record that , at least in the writ petition, the same grounds were taken , whether orally urged or not. The same do require consideration and we do not at this st age deem it appropriate to remand the matter to the Single Judge. 12. We are conscious that though notice of this appeal was issued to the respondent but the respondent remains unserved. We have wondered whether to again list this appeal for service of th e respondent, to consider the aforesaid arguments of the appellant and the response if any of the respondent thereto but have decided against the said course , finding the respondent to be a resident of Indor e, having participated in the hearing before the CIC also through audio conferencing and also for the reason that inspite of the order of the learned Single Judge having remained stayed for the last nearly two years, the respondent has not made any effort to join these proceedings. We have in the circums tances opted to decipher the contentions of the respondent from the memo randa of the first and the second appeal s on record and from his contention in the audio conferencing , as recorded in the order of the CIC. LPA No.487/2011 Page 13 of 19 13. The respondent in the memorandum of fi rst appeal , while admitting the question papers and model answers to be intellectual property of appellant , had pleaded that publication thereof was in larger public interest as the aspiring student s would be able to prepare and understand the pattern of questions asked in super -speciality entrance examination in future. It was also pleaded that question papers of most of the other examinations held were available to the students and generally only 10 -20% of the questions were repeated. It was also his cas e that with the galloping advance ment in medical science, the average student is not able to understand what to study and follow and preparation for the examination would be facilitated for the prospective ex aminees if the question papers are made public. In the memorandum of the second appeal it was also pleaded that when the best faculty was available to the appellant, if did not need to depend on old question papers. During the hearing via audio conferencing before the CIC , the respondent had contended that the question papers could not be termed as intellectual property and it was in larger public interest to provide the questions to the aspiring students who will be able to understand the pattern in which the questions are framed. LPA No.487/2011 Page 14 of 19 14. We tend to agree with the counsel for the appellant that the judgment of the Apex Court in Shaunak H. Satya (supra) cannot be blindly applied to the facts of the present case. The judgment of the Apex Court was in the backdrop of the question papers in that case being av ailable to the examinees during the examination and being also sold together with suggested answers after the examination . Per contra in the present case , the question papers comprise s only of multiple choice questions and are such which cannot be carried out from the examination hall by the examinees and in which examination there is an express prohibition against copying or carrying out of the question papers. Thus the reasoning given by the Supreme Court does not apply to the facts of the present case. 15. We are satisfied that the nature of the examination , subject matter of this appeal , is materially different from the examination consider ed by the Supreme Court in the judgment supra . There are few seats , often limited to one only , in such super -speciality courses and the examinees are highly qualified, post graduate s in the field of medicine. Though the respondent , as aforesaid , has paid tribute s to the faculty of the appellant and credited them with the ingenuity to churn out now question s year afte r year but we cannot ignore the statement in the memorandum of this appeal supported by the LPA No.487/2011 Page 15 of 19 affidavit of the Sub-Dean (Examination s) of the appellant to the effect that the number of multiple choice questions which can be framed for a competitive examinati on for admission to a super -speciality course dealing with one organ only of the human body , are limited. This plea is duly supported by the prohibition on the examinees from copy ing or carry ing out from the examination hall the question papers or any par t thereof. We have no reason to reject such expert view. 16. The Sub-Dean of Examination s of the appellant in the Memorandum of this appeal has further pleaded that if question papers are so disclosed, the possibility of the examination not resulting in t he selection of the best candidate cannot be ruled out. It is pleaded that knowledge of the question papers of all the previous year s with correct answers may lead to selection of a student with good memory rather than an analytical mind. It is also pleaded that setting up of such question papers besides intellectual efforts also entails expenditure. The possibility of appellant , in a given year cutting the said expenditure by picking up questions from its question bank is thus plausible and which factor was considered by the Supreme Court also in the judgment aforesaid. LPA No.487/2011 Page 16 of 19 17. We also need to remind ourselves of the line of the judgment s of which reference may only be made to State of Tamil Nadu Vs. K. Shyam Sunder AIR 2011 SC 3470, The Bihar School Examina tion Board Vs. Subhas Chandra Sinha (1970) 1 SCC 648, The University of Mysore Vs. C. D. Govinda Rao AIR 1965 SC 491, Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Vs. Paritosh Bhupeshkumar Sheth (1984) 4 SCC 27 holding that the Court s should not interfere with such decisions of the academic authorities who are experts in their field. Once the experts of the appellant have taken a view that the disclosure of the question papers would comp romise the selection process, we cannot lightly interfere therewith. Reference in this regard may also be made to the recent dicta in Sanchit Bansal Vs. The Joint Admission Board (JAB) (2012) 1 SCC 157 observing that the process of evaluation and selection of candidates for admission with reference t o their performance, the process of achieving the objective of selecting candidates who will be better equipped to suit the specialized courses, are all technical matters in academic field and Courts will not interfere in such process es. 18. We have in our judgment dated 24.05.2012 in LPA No.1090/2011 titled Central Board of Secondary Education Vs. Sh. Anil Kumar Kathpal , LPA No.487/2011 Page 17 of 19 relying on the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India Vs. Shaunak H. Satya (2011) 8 SCC 781 held that in achieving the objective of transparency and accountability of the RTI Act, other equally important public interests including preservation of confidentiality of sensitive information are not to be ignored or sacrificed and that it has to be ensured that revelation of information in actual practice, does not harm or adversely affect other public interests including of preservation of confidentiality of sensitive information. Thus, disclosure of, marks which though existed, but were replaced by grades, was not allowed. Purposive, no t literal interpretation of the RTI Act was advocated. 19. We may further add that even in Central Board of Secondary Education Vs. Aditya Bandopadhyay (2011) 8 SCC 497 that Apex Court though holding that an examining body does not hold evaluated answer books in fiduciary relationship also held that the RTI Act seeks to bring about a balance between two conflicting interests , as harmony between them is essential for preserving democracy i.e. of transparency and accountability on one hand and public inter est on the other hand. It was further held that when Section 8 exempts certain information, it should not be considered to be a fetter on the Right to Information, but an equally important provision LPA No.487/2011 Page 18 of 19 protecting other public interest s essential for fulfillm ent and preservation of democratic ideas. The Supreme Court further observed that it is difficult to visualize and enumerate all types of information which require to be exempted from disclosure in public interest and the legislature has in Section 8 howe ver made an attempt to do so. I t was thus held that while interpreting the said exemptions a purposive construction involving a reasonable and balanced approach ought to be adopted. It was yet further held that indiscriminate and impractical demands under RTI Act for disclosure of all and sundry information, unrelated to transparency and accountability would be counter productive and the RTI Act should not be allowed to be misused or abused. 20. The information seeker as aforesaid is not the examinee himse lf. The possibility of the information seeker being himself or having acted at the instance of a coaching institute or a publisher and acting with the motive of making commercial gains from such information also cannot be ruled out. The said fact also di stinguishes the present from the context in which Shaunak H. Satya (supra) was decided. There are no question s of transparency and accountability in the present case. LPA No.487/2011 Page 19 of 19 21. When we apply the tests aforesaid to the factual scenario as urged by the appellant s and noted above , the conclusion is irresistible that it is not in public interest that the information sought be divulged and the information sought is such which on a purposive construction of Section 8 is exempt from disclosure. 22. We therefore all ow this appeal and set aside the orders of the CIC directing the appellant to disclose the information and the order of the learned Single Judge dismissing the writ petition preferred by the appellant. No order as to costs. RAJIV SAHAI ENDLAW , J ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE MAY 28, 2012 „M‟ 5/22/2018 delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=51372&yr=2013 http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=51372&yr=2013 1/6 IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI W.P.(C) 7048/2011 SUDHIRRANJAN SENAPATI ADDL.COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX ..... Petitioner Through: Mr. K.G. Sharma, Advocate versus UNION OF INDIA AND ORS ..... Respondents Through: Mr. B.V. Niren, CGSC for R-1 Mr. A.S. Singh and Mr. R.N. Singh, Advocates for R-2 and 3 CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJIV SHAKDHER O R D E R 05.03.2013 1. This petition has been filed to impugn the order dated 18.07.2011 passed by the Central Information Commission (in short CIC). 2. The broad facts which have led to the institution of the present writ petition are as follows :- 3. The petitioner herein is admittedly an accused in criminal proceedings lodged against him by the State, under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The prosecution of the petitioner was apparently sanctioned, at the relevant time, by the concerned authority. 4. It is the sanction accorded qua prosecution, which triggered the petitioner?s request for furnishing information with regard to the decision arrived at in that behalf. Accordingly, an application dated 17.05.2010 was W.P.(C) 7048/2011 Page 1 of 8 5/22/2018 delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=51372&yr=2013 http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=51372&yr=2013 2/6 filed by the petitioner with the Central Public Information Officer (in short CPIO), under the Right to Information Act, 2005 (in short the RTI Act). 4.1 More specifically, the information sought was as follows :- ?..Certified true copies of ?all order sheet entries / Note Sheet entries / File notings of US, VandL / DS, VandL/Director, VandL/JS (Admn.)/Member (PandV)/Chairman, CBDT/Secretary, Revenue/MOS (R), if any, / Finance Minister, if any? pertaining to prosecution sanction by the Central Government u/s. 19(1)(a) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 vide such sanction order dated 09.04.2009 in F.No.C-14011/8/2008-VandL of Central Board of Direct Taxes, Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, GOI, New Delhi..? 4.2 The CPIO vide order dated 16/17.08.2010, declined the request for furnishing information by taking recourse to the provisions of Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act. Pertinently, no reasons were set out in the order. All that is said, in the order of the CPIO is that, requisite information cannot be supplied as the same is exempted from disclosure under Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act. 5. Being aggrieved, the petitioner preferred an appeal with the First Appellate Authority. The appeal met the same fate. By an order dated 05.10.2010, the First Appellate Authority dismissed the petitioner?s appeal. The sum and substance of the rationale given in the order of the First Appellate Authority was that, since criminal prosecution was pending, information sought for by the petitioner could not be disclosed. The First Appellate Authority went on to observe in its order that, any disclosure of information prior to a final decision would be premature and injurious to the process of investigation. Accordingly, relying upon the provisions of W.P.(C) 7048/2011 Page 2 of 8 Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act, it sustained the order of the CPIO. 6. The petitioner being aggrieved, with the order of the First Appellate Authority, preferred an appeal with the CIC. The CIC by virtue of the impugned order dated 18.07.2011, rejected the petitioner?s appeal. By a cryptic order, the CIC accepted the stand of the respondents that information sought for, could not be supplied to the petitioner as the case was pending in court and that disclosure of information would impede the process of prosecution. 7. The learned counsel for the petitioner has impugned the decision of the CIC and the authorities below on the following grounds :- (i). The investigation is complete. The chargesheet qua the accused,5/22/2018 delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=51372&yr=2013 http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=51372&yr=2013 3/6 which includes the petitioner, has been filed in court. On failure of the respondents to demonstrate as to how the disclosure of information would impede prosecution of the petitioner, the said information ordinarily ought to have been supplied to the petitioner. The learned counsel for the petitioner says that disclosure of information is the rule, the denial of the same is an exception. He submits that the exception carved out in Sections 8 and 9 of the RTI Act have thus to be construed strictly. 8. In support of the submission, the learned counsel for the petitioner relies upon the judgment of a Single Judge of this Court in Bhagat Singh Vs. Chief Information Commissioner and ors., 146 (2008) DLT 385. 9. The contesting respondents i.e., respondent nos.2 and 3 are represented by Mr. Singh, who has largely relied upon the stand taken in the counter affidavit. Mr. Singh submits that since the prosecution of the petitioner is ensuing, any disclosure of information would compromise the W.P.(C) 7048/2011 Page 3 of 8 case of the prosecution and hence, cannot be divulged. Recourse was taken to the provisions of Section 8(1)(h) to support the stand of the respondents. 9.1 Mr. Singh also relied upon a judgment of another learned Single Judge of this court, dated 10.11.2006, passed in WP(C) 16712/2006, titled Surinder Pal Singh Vs. Union of India and Others. Mr. Singh submits with all persuasive powers at his command that the facts in Surinder Pal?s case are identical to the present case and therefore having regard to the fact that the court sustained the stand of the official respondents in that case wherein information was denied by taking recourse to the provisions of Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act, similar result ought to follow in the present case. 10. I have heard the learned counsels for the parties and perused the record. 11. At the outset, as noticed above, a chargesheet against the petitioner has been filed and the trial has commenced. Therefore, the questions which falls for consideration is: whether the case of the petitioner would come within the ambit of the provisions of Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act. The said provision reads as follows :- 8. Exemption from disclosure of information ? (i). Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen ? (a). x x x x 5/22/2018 delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=51372&yr=2013 http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=51372&yr=2013 4/6 (b). x x x x (c). x x x x (d). x x x x (e). x x x x (f). x x x x (g). x x x x W.P.(C) 7048/2011 Page 4 of 8 (h). Information which would impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders..? 11.1 As rightly contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner, a learned Single Judge of this court in Bhagat Singh?s case has construed the said provision of the Act to mean that in order to claim exemption under the said provision, the authority withholding the information must disclose satisfactory reasons as to why the release of information would hamper investigation. The reasons disclosed should be germane to the formation of opinion that the process of investigation would be hampered. The said opinion should be reasonable and based on material facts. The learned Single Judge, I may note goes on to observe that sans this consideration, Section 8(1)(h) and other such provisions of the RTI Act would become a ?haven for dogging demands for information?. 11.2 In the light of the aforesaid observations of the learned Single Judge in Bhagat Singh?s case, one would have to see as to whether the affidavit filed on behalf of respondent nos.2 and 3 discloses the reasons as to how information sought, would hamper the prosecution of the petitioner. A perusal of the affidavit shows that no such averment is made in the counter affidavit filed by respondent nos.2 and 3. Undoubtedly, the petitioner here is seeking information with regard to the sanction accorded for his own prosecution. It cannot be disputed, as is noticed by my predecessor, in this very matter, in the order dated 14.10.2011, that the accused during the course of his prosecution can impugn the sanction accorded for his prosecution, on the basis of which the prosecution is launched. For this proposition, the learned Judge, in its order dated 14.10.2011, relies upon the W.P.(C) 7048/2011 Page 5 of 8 following judgments :-5/22/2018 delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=51372&yr=2013 http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=51372&yr=2013 5/6 State Inspector of Police, Visakhapatmam Vs. Surya Sankaran Karri (2006) 7 SCC 172 and Romesh Lal Jain Vs. Naginder Singh Rana, (2006) 1 SCC 294 11.3 I have no reason to differ with the view taken either in Bhagat Singh case or with the prima facie view taken in the order passed by my predecessor in his order dated 14.10.2010. It is trite that an accused can challenge the order by which sanction is obtained to trigger a prosecution against the accused. If that be so, I do not see any good reason to withhold information which, in one sense, is the underlying material, which led to the final order according sanction for prosecution of the petitioner. As a matter of fact, the trial court is entitled to examine the underlying material on the basis of which sanction is accorded when a challenge is laid to it, to determine for itself as to whether the sanctioning authority had before it the requisite material to grant sanction in the matter. See observations in Gokulchand Dwarkadas Morarka vs The King AIR 1948 PC 82 and State of Karnataka vs Ameerjan (2007) 11 SCC 273. Therefore, the said underlying material would be crucial to the cause of the petitioner, who seeks to defend himself in criminal proceedings, which the State as the prosecutor cannot, in my opinion, withhold unless it can show that such information, would hamper prosecution. 12. As indicated above, no reasons are set out in the counter affidavit. The argument of Mr. Singh that a Single Judge of this court in Surinder Pal Singh?s case (supra) has taken a view in favour of the respondents, is not quite correct, for the reason that the learned Single Judge in the facts and W.P.(C) 7048/2011 Page 6 of 8 circumstances of that case came to the conclusion that the apprehension of the respondent i.e., the State in that case, was ?not without any basis?. 12.1 It appears in that case the petitioner, who was being criminally prosecuted for having fraudulently reduced the quantum of excise duty to be paid by an assessee, while passing an adjudication order, had sought information with regard to: note sheets; correspondence obtaining qua the material in the file of the CBI; correspondence in the file of the CVC pertaining to the matter; and correspondence in the file of the Department of Vigilance, CBES. 12.2 A close perusal of the nature of information sought seems to suggests that much of it may have been material collected during the course of investigation, the disclosure of which could have perhaps hampered the prosecution of the petitioner. 13. Therefore, in my view, in such like cases when, the State takes a stand the information cannot be disclosed; while dilating on its stand in5/22/2018 delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=51372&yr=2013 http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=51372&yr=2013 6/6 that behalf, the State would necessarily have to, deal with the aspect as to how the information sought, is of such a nature, that it could impede prosecution. Much would thus depend, on the nature of information sought, in respect of which, a clear stand needs to be taken by the State, while declining the information. The burden in this regard is on the State [see B.S. Mathur Vs. Public Information Officer of Delhi High Court, 180 (2011) DLT 303] 13.1 The facts obtaining in Surinder Pal case?s are distinguishable and hence, the ratio of that judgment would not apply to the facts obtaining in the present case. 13.2 It also be noted that the learned Single Judge?s view in Bhagat Singh W.P.(C) 7048/2011 Page 7 of 8 case has been upheld by a reasoned order by the Division Bench in Directorate of Income Tax and Anr. Vs. Bhagat Singh, dated 17.12.2007 passed in LPA 1377/2007. 14. With the aforesaid observations in place, the writ petition is allowed. The order of the CIC is set aside. The respondents will supply the information sought for by the petitioner within three weeks from today, after redacting names of officers who wrote the notes or made entries in the concerned files.

JUSTICE RAJIV SHAKDHER O R D E R % 22.04.2015 1. These are two writ petitions placed before me. The first w rit petition ; being W.P.(C) No.3616/2012 , assails the order dated 5.12.2011 , passed by the Central Information Commission (in short the CIC) . In the second writ petition, being W.P. (C) No. 405/2014 , a challenge has been laid to order dated 26.6.2013 , passed by the CIC . 2. There are two issues which, according to the learned counsels for the parties , arise for consideration of this court. The se are as follows: - W.P.(C) 3616/2012 & W.P.(C) 405/2014 Page 2 of 9 (i) Whether , the respondent , is entitled to the information sought which, essentially, pertains to his own prosecution in a criminal case lodged by the Central Bureau of Investigation (in short the CBI) ? (ii) Whether , the notification dated 9.6.2011 whereby , the CBI has been included in the second schedule to the Right to Informati on Act, 2005 (in short the RTI Act) , will impact the application s filed by the respondent prior to the said date, i.e. , on 28.02.2011 and 5.5.2011 ? 3. Before I proceed further, I may only indicate that the respondent had filed a third application under the RTI Act, which is, dated 26.12.2011 . The respondent, who appears in person, says that he does not wish to press the application dated 26.12.2011. 4. The mat ter has reached this court in the background of the following facts: 4.1 The respondent, who at one time, was serving as the Chairperson of the Appellate Tribunal for Foreign Exchange (in short the Tribunal) , had a criminal case regi stered against him by t he CBI. This case was registered by the CBI , in 2007. The investigation , in this case , was carried on and , admittedly , a charge sheet was filed by the CBI , in the competent court on 20.12.2010. 4.2 I am informed by the respondent that no charges have bee n framed to date. 4.3 Be that as it may, on 28.2.2011, the respondent filed an application before the Central Public Information Officer (in short the CPIO) of the CBI, seeking information with regard to certain aspects. Since , information was not furn ished to the respondent, the respondent preferred an application with the First Appellate Authority (in short the FAA) . W.P.(C) 3616/2012 & W.P.(C) 405/2014 Page 3 of 9 4.4 On 18.4.2011, some part of the information was supplied to the respondent. The CPIO , also filed , its reply to the appeal , on 3.5.2 011, which was finally disposed of by the FAA on 5.5.2011. The petitioner on that very date, filed a second application under the RTI Act. This application is also dated 5.5.2011. 4.5 The respondent, being aggrieved by the order dated 5.5.2011 , passed by the FAA, decided to prefer a second appeal with the CIC. This appeal was filed on 1.6.2011. Pertinently, while the appeal was pending before the CIC, on 9.6.2011, the Government of India issued a notification whereby , CBI was placed in the second schedu le of the RTI Act, as indicated above. The effect of this notification and the inclusion of the CBI in the second schedule was that it could avail of the protective shield provided by Section 24 of the RTI Act. In other words, agencies which are included in the second schedule of the RTI Act , are exempted from the provisions of the RTI. The exception of course being , qua information pertaining to allegations of corruption and human rights violation. 4.6 The CIC, vide order dated 5.12.2011 partially all owed the appeal of the respondent. The operative directions contained in the order of the CIC are as under: “8. In any contingency, the Commission hereby directs that the information sought by the Appellant on Query Nos.3 & 6 of his RTI Application must be provided to him free of cost within 15 days of the receipt of this Order. Since the information sought by the Appellant under Query No.1 is not maintained in its official record by the R espondent Ministry, the Commission cannot direct the Respondent to create and provide the same. However, it shall be open for the Respondent Ministry to call for such in formation from the CBI, in case it decides W.P.(C) 3616/2012 & W.P.(C) 405/2014 Page 4 of 9 to complete and maintain its own official file records and if so happens, then the Appellate will be entitled to get such information under the RTI Act.” 4.7 To be noted, the directions contained in paragraph 8 were passed in the context of the queries set out in the respondent’s application dated 28.2.2011. The queries, which the respondent made and in respect of which he had sought information are set out in paragraph 1 of the order dated 5.12.2011 , passed by the CIC . The queries , as recorded in the order, are extracted hereinafter : “1. The date and nature of permission sought for by the CBI in 2007 to regist er a criminal case against Sh. O.P. Nahar, the then Chairman ATFE, and the documents filed in support of the request. 2. Whether sought for permission is granted or declined and on what date along with reasons for such decision. 3. The notings recorded by the CVO and the Law Secretary while taking decision on the request of the CBI. Also name the final authority who took decision on the above described request and the reasons thereof. 4. Any replies, if sought for from Sh. O.P. Nahar before taking th e final decision then supply the c omments received from him. 5. Provide details of procedure adopted with documents before taking final decision on the matter. 6. Did CBI request on second occasion in 2009 for the grant of permission , if yes, then supp ly the date and copy of the second request or otherwise the first decision is over -ruled suo moto on the same facts narrated in the CBI’s request. Please supply the documents and the notings made by the CVO, the Law Secretary or any other authority functi oning W.P.(C) 3616/2012 & W.P.(C) 405/2014 Page 5 of 9 in this regard. 7. Is it a fact firstly that the 2007 request by CBI was declined but later in 2009 same request is granted without any addition of fresh factual difference or fresh request , if so, then supply the reasons recorded for change of the old decision and name the authority with their notings on what they recorded this regard”. 4.8 Since directions were issued by the CIC only with regard to query Nos.1, 3 & 6, the same are set out hereinbelow: “1. The date and nature of permission sought for by the CBI in 2007 to register a criminal case against Shri O.P. Nahar, the then Chairman ATFE and the documents filed in support of the request ...” “3. The notings recorded by the CVO and the Law Secretary while taking decision on the request of the CBI. Also name the final authority who took decision on the above described request and the reasons thereof. ..” “6. Did CBI request on second occasion in 2009 for the grant of permission, if yes, then supply the date and copy of the second request or oth erwise the first decision is over-ruled suo moto on the same facts narrated in the CBI’s request. Please supply the documents and the notings made by the CVO, the Law Secretary or any other authority functioning in this regard ...” 4.9. Insofar as the sec ond order of the CIC is concerned, which is dated 26.6.2013, the operative directions passed by the CIC are contained in paragraph 10 of the said order. For the sake of convenience, the same are extracted hereinbelow: “10. Having considered the submissio ns of the parties W.P.(C) 3616/2012 & W.P.(C) 405/2014 Page 6 of 9 and perused the relevant documents on the file, the Commission finds that the CBI has been exempted under the provisions of the RTI Act vide Notification dated 9.6.2011 whereas the appellant’s RTI application is dated 5.5.2011 , which is p rior to the said Notification. Therefore, the CBI was not an exempted organisation at the time of filing of the RTI application. Moreover, it has not been explained by the respondent how the disclosure of the information in the present case can impe de the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders, which is admittedly over. The Commission hereby directs the Deputy Secretary/Vig. & CPIO to provide to the appellant the documents as requested by him at Para 9 above within two weeks of receipt of this order. ” 5. The issues , therefore, in these facts, which arise for consideration, have been set out hereinabove. 6. Mr. Mishra, who appears for the CBI, says that CBI is not obliged to provide any information of the kind that CIC has d irected for the reason that it is an agency which falls within the ambit of the second schedule of the RTI Act. 6.1 This apart, it is Mr. Mishra’s contention that the provisions of Section 8(1)(h) of the Act clearly provides that notwithstanding anything contained in the RTI Act, there would be no obligation on the holder of information to provide such information which would impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of the offenders. 6.2 This submission is made by Mr. Mishra in support of his contention that, even if , the respondent’s stand was to be accepted , that a vested right enured in his favour , on 28.2.2011 , and thereafter on 5.5.2011 , the said information , can be denied if , the information would “impede ” investigation W.P.(C) 3616/2012 & W.P.(C) 405/2014 Page 7 of 9 or apprehension or prosecution of the offender. 7. The respondent, who appears in person, says that the provision of the Act, in particular, Section 7 is indicative of the fact that the holder of the information, i.e. a public authority, is required to furni sh the information within a period of 30 days. The respondent submits that the period of 30 days, in this case , was well and truly over , if one were to have regard to the date of the first application , which is , dated 28.2.2011. 8. Insofar as the second a pplication is concerned, the period of 30 days also came to an end prior to the date of notification, which is , 9.6.2011. 9. I have heard the learned counsels for the parties. According to me, what is important is the events which occurred prior to the issuance of the notification dated 9.6.2011 . Admittedly, two applications were filed by the respondent to seek information. The first application, as indicated above, is dated 28.2.2011 . The second application is dated 5.5.2011. 10. I had asked Mr. Mish ra as to what was the date of receipt of the application, which is dated 5.5.2011 . Mr. Mishra was not able to furnish any information in that regard. 10.1 The moot point , which has been raised in the second petition , is whether notification dated 9.6.2011 , will apply , to an application filed prior to that date. Th e said aspect should have, therefore, been adverted to by the petitioner in, at least, the second writ petition. Therefore, it will have to be presumed, at this juncture, that the application was received by the petitioner herein on 5.5.2011. 11. Having regard to the provisions of Section 7 of the RTI , it was incumbent upon the petitioner to furnish the information sought , if otherwise permissible , under the provisions of the RT I Act, within 30 da ys of the W.P.(C) 3616/2012 & W.P.(C) 405/2014 Page 8 of 9 receipt of the application. The information having not been supplied, a vested right accrued in favour of the respondent after the completion of the 30 days and, therefore, notification dated 9.6.2011 insofar as the respondent is concerned, in m y view cannot come in his way. Therefore, this would be the position not only vis -a-vis the application dated 28.02.2011 but also qua application dated 05.05.2011. 12. This brings me to the other question, which is : whether the petitioner can take recour se to the provisions of Section 8(1)(h) of the Act to deny information to the respondent . The relevant provisions of Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act read as follows: - “8. Exemption from disclosure of information . — (1) Notwithstanding anything contained i n this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen, — ... (h) information which would impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders; (emphasis is mine) 13. A careful reading of the provision would show t hat the holder of the information ca n only withhold the information if, it is able to demonstrate that the information would “impede” the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of the offenders. 14. In the present case, the facts, as set o ut hereinabove, clearly demonstrate that the investigation is over . The charge sheet in the case was filed, as far back as on 31.12.2010. 14.1 The question then is, would the information sought for by the respondent “impede ” the respondent’s apprehensio n or prosecution. The respondent is in court and he says that he has been granted bail by the W.P.(C) 3616/2012 & W.P.(C) 405/2014 Page 9 of 9 competent court. Therefore, prima faice, the view of the competent court, which is trying him, is that there is no impediment in apprehen ding the respondent , and that he would be available as and when required by the court. The petition makes no averments as to how the information sought for by the respondent would prevent his prosecution. 14.2 In that view of the matter, according to me the provisions of Sectio n 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act will not help the ca use of the petitioner. Accordingly, the information, as directed by the CIC, will have to be supplied to the respondent. It so ordered. In support of this proposition, I may only advert to the following judgm ents of this Court (See Bhagat Singh v. Chief Information Commissioner [2008 (100) DRJ 63] ; B.S. Mathur v. Public Information Officer of Delhi High Court [180 (2011) DLT 303] ; Adesh Kumar v. Union of India and Ors. [216 (2015) DLT 230]; Director of Income Tax (Investigation) and Anr. v. Bhagat Singh and Anr. [(2008) 168 TAXMAN 190 (Delhi)] ; Sudhir Ranjan Senapati v. Addl. Commissioner of Income Tax, W.P.(C) 7048 /2011 dated 5.3.2013 ; and Pradeep Singh Jadon v.

Present batch of writ petitions has been filed challenging the order s of the Central Information Commission (for short ‘CIC’) whereby the petitioner -Ministry of External Affairs has been directed to provide copie s of passport s of third parties along with their birth certificates, education al qualifications and identity pro ofs. Since the reasoning of the CIC in all the impugned orders is identical , the relevant portion of the impugned order in W.P.(C) 3406/2012 is reproduced hereinbelow: - “We can also look at this from another aspect. The State has no right to invade the privacy of individual. There are some extraordinary situations where the State may be allowed to invade the privacy of a Citizen. In those circ umstances special provisions of the law apply; - usually with certain safeguards. Therefore where the State routinely obtains information from Citizens, this information is in relationship to a public activity and will not be an intrusion on privacy . Certain human rights such as liberty, freedom of expression or right to life are universal and therefore would apply uniformly to all human beings worldwide. However, the concept of „privacy‟ is a cultural notion, related to social norms, and different societ ies would look at these differently. Therefore referring to the UK Data protection act or the laws of other countries to define „privacy‟ cannot be considered a valid exercise to constrain the Citizen‟s fundamental Right to Information in India. Parliame nt has not codified the right to privacy so far, hence in balancing the Right to Information of Citizens and the W.Ps.(C) 3406 /2012, 8915/2011, 410/2012 Page 3 of 9 individual‟s Right to Privacy the Citizen‟s Right to Information would be given greater weightage. The Supreme Court of India has ruled that C itizens have a right to know about charges against candidates for elections as well as details of their assets, since they desire to offer themselves for public service. It is obvious then that those who are public servants cannot claim exemption from dis closure of charges against them or details of their assets . Given our dismal record of misgovernance and rampant corruption which colludes to deny Citizens their essential rights and dignity, it is in the fitness of things that the Citizen‟s Right to Info rmation is given greater primacy with regard to privacy.” 2. Despite filing affidavit of service, none has appeared for the respondents today. Even yesterday, none had appeared for the respondents. Consequently, this Court has no other option but to procee d with the matter ex parte . 3. Mr. Rakesh Tiku , learned senior counsel for petitioners submits that CIC failed to appreciate that the passport application contains person al information and if disclosed, would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of third par ty. He further submits that even if the CIC ca me to the conclusion that the information sought for was not exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the Right to Information Act, 2005 (for short ‘RTI Act’), it would still have to follow the third par ty information procedure under Section 11 of the RTI Act. 4. Mr. Tiku fairly points out that in connected matters , i.e., W.P.(C) Nos. 2232/2012, 8932/2011, 3421/2012, 1263/2012, 1677/2012, 1794/2012, 2231/2012 , a co -ordinate bench of this Court has directed the Ministry of External Affairs to give detail s of passport to third part ies like passport number, date of its first issue, subsequent renewals, the name of police W.Ps.(C) 3406 /2012, 8915/2011, 410/2012 Page 4 of 9 station from which verification had been done, nature of documents submitted with the passpo rt application without disclosing the contents of those documents along with the information as to whether Visa was issued to the third party. 5. Mr. Tiku, however, submits that the reasoning in W.P.(C) 2232/2012 for release of third party information that th e said information was generated by Ministry of External Affairs, is untenable in law. According to him, if this reasoning were to be accepted , then a third party’s Permanent Account Number (PAN) and password would also be liable to be disclosed as the same are generated by the Income Tax Department. He states that if an applicant were to get a third party’s PAN and password details, he would be able to find out his financial details like income, tax paid etc. 6. This Court finds that the concept of third p arty information has been comprehensively dealt with in the RTI Act. Some of the relevant sections pertaining to third party as well as personal information are reproduced hereinbelow: - “2. Definitions. —In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, — xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx (n) “third party”' means a person other than the citizen making a request for information and includes a public authority. xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx 8. Exemption from disclosure of information. —(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen, — xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx (j) information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or W.Ps.(C) 3406 /2012, 8915/2011, 410/2012 Page 5 of 9 interest, or which would cause unwarranted i nvasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such inf ormation: Provided that the information which cannot be denied to the Parliament or a State Legislature shall not be denied to any person. xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx 11. Third party information. —(1) Where a Central Public Information Officer or a State Publi c Information Officer, as the case may be, intends to disclose any information or record, or part thereof on a request made under this Act, which relates to or has been supplied by a third party and has been treated as confidential by that third party, the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, shall, within five days from the receipt of the request, give a written notice to such third party of the request and of the fact that the Central Public Informati on Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, intends to disclose the information or record, or part thereof, and invite the third party to make a submission in writing or orally, regarding whether the information should be disclosed, and such submission of the third party shall be kept in view while taking a decision about disclosure of information: Provided that except in the case of trade or commercial secrets protected by law, disclosure may be allowed if the public interest in disclosure outweighs in importance any possible harm or injury to the interests of such third party. xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx 19. Appeal. - xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx (4) If the decision of the Central Pub lic Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, against W.Ps.(C) 3406 /2012, 8915/2011, 410/2012 Page 6 of 9 which an appeal is preferred relates to information of a third party, the Central Information Commission or State Information Commission, as the case may be, shall giv e a reasonable opportunity of being heard to that third party. ” 7. Keeping in view the aforesaid provisions, this Court is of the view that the proper approach to be adopted in cases where personal information with regard to third parties is asked is first to determine whether information sought falls under Section 8(1) (j) of the RTI Act and if the Court/Tribunal reaches the conclusion that aforesaid exemption is not attracted, then the third party procedure referred to in Section 11(1) of the RTI Act must b e followed before releasing the information. 8. This Court finds that except making general observations in the impugned matters, CIC has not considered the aforesaid binding statutory provisions. In fact, the impugned order is based on surmises and conjectur es. CIC has not pointed out as to how any of its general observations with regard to mis -governance, rampant corruption by public servants and politicians have any relevance to the present batch of cases. CIC has nowhere stated in the impugned orders tha t third parties are either public servants or politicians or persons in power. 9. CIC has neither examined the issue whether large r public interest justifies the disclosure of the information sought by the applicants in the se cases nor has followed the thir d party procedure prescribed under Section s 11 and 19(4) of RTI Act. 10. This Court also finds that the observations given by learned Single Judge in the batch of writ petitions being W.P.( C) 2232/2012 are without taking into account the binding provisions o f Section s 11(1) and 19(4) of the W.Ps.(C) 3406 /2012, 8915/2011, 410/2012 Page 7 of 9 RTI Act. In particular the learned Single Judge erred in observing in W.P.( C) 1677 /2012 that passport number is not a personal information. This Court is in agreement with Mr. Tiku’s submission that as to who generates a third party information, is totally irrelevant. After all passport number is not only personal information but also an identification proof, specifically when one travels abroad. 11. This Court is also of the view that if passport number of a third party is furnished to an applicant, it can be misused. For instance, if the applicant were to lodge a report with the police that a passport bearing a particular number is lost, the Passport Authority would automatically revoke the same without knowledge and to the prejudice of the third party. 12. Further, the observations of learned Single Judge in the aforesaid batch of writ petitions are contrary to the judgment of another learned Single Judge in Suhas Chakma Vs. Central Information Commission, W.P.(C) 9118/2009 decided on 2nd January, 2010 as well as a Division Bench’s judgment in Harish Kumar Vs. Provost Marshal -Cum -Appellate Authority & Ors., LPA 253/2012 decided on 30th March, 2012 . In Suhas Chakma (supra) another learned Single Judge has held as under: - “5. The Court is of the considered view that information which involves the rights of privacy of a third party in terms of Section 8(1)(j) RTI Act cannot be ordered to be disclosed without notice to such third party. The authority cannot simply come to conclusio n, that too, on a concession or on the agreement of parties before it, that public interest overrides the privacy rights of such third party without notice to and hearing such third party. ” 13. The relevant portion of the Division Bench in Harish Kumar (supra ) is reproduced hereinbelow: - W.Ps.(C) 3406 /2012, 8915/2011, 410/2012 Page 8 of 9 “9. What we find in the present case is that the PIO had not refused the information. All that the PIO required the appellant to do was, to follow third party procedure. No error can be found in the said reasoning of the PIO. Under Section 11 of the Act, the PIO if called upon to disclose any information relating to or supplied by a third party and which is to be treated as confidential, is required to give a notice to such third party and is to give an opportunity to such thir d party to object to such disclosure and to take a decision only thereafter. 10. There can be no dispute that the information sought by the appellant was relating to a third party and supplied by a third party. We may highlight that the appellant also wa nted to know the caste as disclosed by his father -in-law in his service record. The PIO was thus absolutely right in, response to the application for information of the appellant, calling upon the appellant to follow the third party procedure under Section 11. Reliance by the PIO on Section 8 (1) (j) which exempts from disclosure of personal information and the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest and which would cause unwanted invasion of the privacy of the individual was also apposite. Our constitutional aim is for a casteless society and it can safely be assumed that the disclosure made by a person of his or her caste is intended by such person to be kept confidential. The appellant however as aforesaid, wanted to ste al a march over his father -in-law by accessing information, though relating to and supplied by the father -in-law, without allowing his father -in-law to oppose to such request. ” 14. The Supreme Court in Municipal Corporation of Delhi Vs. Gurman Kaur, (1989) 1 SCC 101 has held that a decision of a Court is per incuriam when it is given in ignorance of the terms of a statute. In the present case, as the direction of learned Single Judge in the aforesaid batch of writ petitions bearing W.P.(c) 2232/2012 is specif ically contrary to Section 11(1) of the RTI Act, this Court is of the view that it is per incuriam . W.Ps.(C) 3406 /2012, 8915/2011, 410/2012 Page 9 of 9 15. Consequently, present writ petitions are allowed and the impugned orders dated 11th April, 2012 passed in W.P.(C) 3406/2012; 21st October, 2011 in W.P.(C) 8915/2011 ; and 19th December, 2011 in W.P.(C) 410/2012 by CIC are set aside. The applications stand disposed of.

CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE S. RAVINDRA BHAT 1. Whether the Reporters of local papers Yes may be allowed to see the judgment? 2. To be referred to Reporter or not? Yes 3. Whether the judgment should be Yes reported in the Digest? Hon’ble Mr. Justice S. Ravindra Bhat 1. The petitioner in this proceeding under Article 226 of the Consti tution of India, challenges a decision of the Central Information Commission (CIC) dated 17.12.2008 (the impugned order] affirming the decision of the appellate authority under the Right to Information Act, 2005 *hereafter, “the Information Act”+ not to al low disclosure of the information sought. 2. The facts necessary for deciding the case are that the petitioner is a former officer of the Indian Air For ce. He apparently got married in 2001. According to the averments, he had sought resignation from the Indian Air Force, which was granted on 30.09.2001. His wife was inducted W.P.(C) 803/2009 Page 2 of 16 in the Defence Research Development Organization (DRDO) on 31.03.2005 and was pos ted at 4, Air Force Selection Board (“AFSB”), Varanasi. Eventually, differences cropped up between the two, and his wife applied for divorce. The petitioner caused to be served, through his counsel , an application to the Station Commander, 4 AFSB, requesti ng for information in respect of his wife’s service records pertaining to all leave application forms submitted by her; attested copies of nomination of DSOP and other official documents with financial implications , and the changes made to them; record of investments made and reflected in the service documents of his wife, along with nominations thereof. 3. The information application was declined by the Public Information Officer, i.e. the Wing Commander of the 4, AFSB by his letter dated 25.04.2007 on the ground that the particulars sought for related to personal informatio n, exempted under Section 8(1)(j ) of the Inform ation Act; that disclosure of such information had no relation with any public activity or interest and that it would cause unwarranted inv asion into the privacy of the individual. The petitioner felt aggrieved and preferred an appeal under Section 19 of the Information Act. The appeal was rejected by an order dated 25.01.2008 by the Air Vice Marshal, Senior Officer Incharge, Administration , of the Indian Air Force, who was the designated A ppellate authority. Feeling aggrieved, the writ petitioner preferred a second appeal to the Central Information Commissioner. 4. By the impugned order, the CIC, after discussing the arguments and pleas advan ced, rejected the appeal. The relevant part of the impugned order, upholding the determination of the authorities, including the appellate authority is as follows: - W.P.(C) 803/2009 Page 3 of 16 “During the hearing, the Appellant submitted that the information sought was required for p roducing before the Competent Court where a dispute was pending between him and Dr. Sandhya Verma and the information was necessary for fair trial. The Respondents submitted that the information was necessary pertained to personal information concerning Dr . Sandhya Verma, a Third Party and had no relationship to any public interest or activity and, therefore, exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the Right to Information Act. The information which has been sought includes, attested copies of all t he leave application forms submitted by Dr. S. Verma since she was posted to 4 AFSB, copies of nomination of DSOP/other official documents with financial implications and record of investment made and reflected thereon in service documents along with the nominations thereof, if explicitly made. The information sought is obviously personal information concerning Dr. Sandhya Verma, a Third Party. It is immaterial if Dr. Sandhya Verma happens to be the wife of the Appellant. The information sought does not see m to have any relationship to any public interest or public activity and has been expressly sought to be used as evidence in a dispute in a Court pending between the Appellant and Dr. Sandhya Verma. The decision of the CPIO, upheld by the Appellate Authori ty, in denying the information by invoking the exemption provision of Section 8(1)(j) of the Right to Information Act seem to be absolutely right and just. We find no reason to interfere with the decision of the Appellate Authority and, thus, reject the appeal.” 5. The writ petitioner, a self -represented litigant, argues that the approach of the authorities under the Information Act has been unduly narrow and technical. He emphasized that by virtue of Section 6, a right is vested in every person to claim in formation of all sorts which exists on the record. He relied upon Section 2 (i) and (j) to say that information under the Act has been defined in the widest possible manner and that the question of exceptions should be construed from the perspective of the right rather than the exemptions, which has been done in this case. Reliance was placed upon Division Bench ruling in Surup Singh Hrya Naik v. State of Maharashtra AIR 2007 Bom 121 to submit that ordinarily information sought for by person must be made av ailable without disclosure by him about the reason why he seeks it. It is submitted further that a close reading of the decision would show that the public right to W.P.(C) 803/2009 Page 4 of 16 information ordinarily prevails over the private interest of a third party, who may be affe cted. Particularly, it was emphasized that the Court should always keep in mind the object of the Act, which is to make public authorities accountable and open and the contention that the information might be misused is of no consequence. It was submitted lastly that even if there is a rule prohibiting disclosure of information, that would yield to the dictates of the Information Act, as the latter acquires supremacy. 6. It was consequently urged that in the context of this case, th e information sought for was not really of a third party, but pertained to the petitioner’s wife. Although they are facing each other in litigation, nevertheless, having regard to their relationship, the invocation of Section 8(1)(j) was not justified. 7. The petitioner contended further that the grounds urged, i.e. lack of public interest and unwarranted intrusion of privacy, were unavailable in this case. It was submitted in this regard that being a public official, the petitioner’s wife was under a duty to make proper and truthful disclosure; the pleadings made by her in the divorce proceedings, contained untruthful averments. These could be effectively negatived by disclosure of information available with the respondents. Therefore, there was sufficient public interest in the disclosure of information. 8. The Indian Air Force (IAF), which has been impleaded as second respondent argues that the impugned decision is justified and in consonance with law. It argued that what constitutes “public interest” is d efined in Black’s Law Dictionary (6th Edition) at page 1229 as follows: “Public Interest: Something in which the public, the community at large, has some pecuniary interest by which their legal rights or liabilities are affected. It W.P.(C) 803/2009 Page 5 of 16 does not mean anything so narrow as mere curiosity, or as the interests of the particular localities, which may be affected by the matters in question……” 9. It is urged that the Information Act was brought into force as a means of accessing information under the control of public authorities, to citizens with the object of promoting transparency and accountability. This regime, is however, subject to reasonabl e restrictions or exemptions. Particular reliance is placed upon the non -obstante clause contained in Section 8, which lists out the various exemptions. It was submitted that if the disclosure of personal information has no relation to any public activity or interest, the authorities under the Act within their rights in denying disclosure. The counsel contended in this regard that there is no element of public interest, in relation to the private matrimonial litigation pending before the Court between the petitioner and his wife. Similarly, the action of filing information in relation to one’s assets and investments, with the public authority, per se , is not a public activity, and contents of such disclosure cannot be accessed. It was argued that in additi on, the disclosure of such information (which is meant purely for the records and for the use of the employer) , during inappropriate instances, is bound to cause unwarranted loss of privacy to the individual. Therefore, in the overall conspectus of the fac ts of this case, even though the parties were married to each other, as a policy matter, the IAF acted within the bounds of law in denying access to the information submitted by the petitioner’s wife. 10. The relevant provisions of the Information Act, in the context of this case, are extracted below: “2. Definitions. - In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, - W.P.(C) 803/2009 Page 6 of 16 (f) “information” means any material in any form, including records, documents, memos, e -mails, opinions, advices, press releases, circul ars, orders, logbooks, contracts, reports, papers, samples, models, data material held in any electronic form and information relating to any private body which can be accessed by a public authority under any other law for the time being in force; XXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXX (j) “right to information” means the right to information accessible under this Act which is held by or under the control of any public authority and includes the right to - (i) inspection of work, documents, records; (ii) taking notes, ext racts or certified copies of documents or records; (iii) taking certified samples of material; (iv) obtaining information in the form of diskettes, floppies, tapes, video cassettes or in any other electronic mode or through printouts where such information is stored in a computer or in any other device; XXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXX 8. Exemption from disclosure of information. - (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen, - XXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXX (j) information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Off icer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information: Provided that the information which cannot be denied to the Parliament or a State Legislature shall not be denied to any person. XXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXX 11. Third party information. -(1) Where a Central Public Information Officer or a State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, intends to disclose any information or record, or part thereof on a request made under this Act, which relates to or has been supplied by a third party and has been treated as confidential by that third party, the Central Public Information Officer or State W.P.(C) 803/2009 Page 7 of 16 Public Information Officer, as the case may be, shall, within five days from the receipt of the request, give a written notice to such third party of the request and of the fact that the Central Public Information Officer, as the case may be, intends to disclose the information or record, or part thereof, and invite the third party to make a submission in writing or orally, regarding whether the information should be disclosed, and such submission of the third party shall be kept in view while taking a decision about disclosure of informati on: Provided that except in the case of trade or commercial secrets protected by law, disclosure may be allowed if the public interest in disclosure outweighs in importance any possible harm or injury to the interests of such third party. (2) Where a noti ce is served by the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, under sub -section (1) to a third party in respect of any information or record or part thereof, the third party shall, within ten days from the date of receipt of such notice, be given the opportunity to make representation against the proposed disclosure. (3) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 7, the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case m ay be, shall, within forty days after receipt of the request under Section 6, if the third party has been given an opportunity to make representation under sub -section(2), make a decision as to whether or not to disclose the information or record or part thereof and give in writing the notice of his decision to the third party. (4) A notice given under sub -section (3) shall include a statement that the third party to whom the notice is given is entitled to prefer an appeal under section 19 against the deci sion.” 11. The precise question to be decided here is whether records relating to investments of, and financial disclosure made during the course of employment by the petitioner’s wife were justifiably withheld on grounds of lack of public interest elemen t and likelihood of invasion of privacy. 12. In the decision relied upon by the petitioner reported as Surup Singh Hrya Naik v. State of Maharashtra (supra) , the Bombay High Court had to deal with the question whether disclosure of medical records of a mem ber of the Legislative Assembly, who had been W.P.(C) 803/2009 Page 8 of 16 imprisoned for contempt of Court, for a month, was protected by the exemption under Section 8(1)(j). The Court dealt with the argument that in terms of regulations framed by the Indian Medical Council (IMC), su ch records were confidential. However, the argument that such confidentiality obliged the Government to deny the request , was turned -down on the ground that the regulations had to yield to provisions of the Act and that unless the third party made out a st rong case for denial, such information could always be disclosed. In the course of its reasoning, the Division Bench emphasized that the proviso to Section 8(1)(j) clothes Parliament and State Legislatures with plenary powers, which in turn implied that al l manner of information was capable of disclosure and could not, therefore, be withheld. 13. Under the scheme of the Information Act, the expressions “record”, “information”, “right to Information” have been given the widest possible amplitude. By virtue of Sections 3, 5, 6 and 7, every public authority requested to provide information is under a positive obligation to do so; the information seeker is under no obligation to disclose why he requests it. The information provider or the concerned agency is fu rther, obliged to decide the application within prescribed time limits. A hierarchy of authorities is created with the CIC, at the apex to decide disputes pertaining to information disclosure. In this Scheme, the Parliament has in its wisdom, visualized ce rtain exemptions. Section 8 lists those exemptions; it opens with a non- obstante clause, signifying the intention that irrespective of the rights of the information seeker, in regard to matters listed under that provision, the information providers can justifiably withhold access to the information seeker the record, information or queries sought for by him. This case concerns the applicability of Section 8(1)(j). W.P.(C) 803/2009 Page 9 of 16 14. The right to access public information, that is, information in the possession of state agencies and governments, in democracies is an accountability measure empowering citizens to be aware of the actions taken by such state “actors”. This transparency value, at the same time, has to be reconciled with the legal interests protected by law, such as other fundamental rights, particularly the fundamental right to privacy. This balancing or reconciliation becomes even more crucial if we take into account the effects of the technological challenges which arise on account of privacy. Certain conflicts may arise in particular cases of access to information and the protection of personal data, stemming from the fact that both rights cannot be exercised absolutely. The rights of all those affected must be respected, and no right can prevail over others, except in clear and express circumstances. 15. To achieve the above purpose , the I nformation Act outlines a clear list of the matters that cannot be made public. There are two types of information seen as exceptions to access; the fir st usually refers to those matters limited to the State in protection of the general public good, such as security of State , matters relating to investigation , sensitive cabinet deliberations, etc. In cases where state information is reserved, the relevant authorities must prove the damage that diffusion of information will effectively cause to the legal interests protected by law, so that the least amount of information possible is reserved to benefit the individual, thus facilitating governmental activiti es. The second class of information with state or its agencies, is personal data of both citizens and artificial or juristic entities, like corporations. Individuals’ personal data is protected by the laws of access to confidentiality and by privacy rights . W.P.(C) 803/2009 Page 10 of 16 16. Demo cratic societies undoubtedly have to guarantee the right of access to public information; it is also true that such societies’ legal regimes must safeguard the individual’s right to privacy. Both these rights are often found at the same “regulat ory level”. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, through Article 19 articulates the right to information as follows: “Ever yone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers”. Article 12 of the same Declara tion provides that, “no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or atta cks”. 17. The scheme of the Information Act no doubt is premised on disclosure being the norm, and refusal, the exception. Apart from the classes of exceptions, they also appear to work at different levels or stages, in the enactment. Thus, for instance, several organizations –security, and intelligence agencies, are excluded from the regime, by virtue of Section 24, read with the Second Schedule to the Act. The second level of exception is enacted in Section 8, which lists 11 categories or classes (clause s (a) to (j)) that serve as guidelines for non -disclosure. Though by Section 22, the Act overrides other laws, the opening non-obstante clause in Section 8 (“notwithstanding anything contained in this Act”) confers primacy to the exemptions, enacted under Section 8(1). Clause (j) embodies the exception of information in the possession of the public authority which relates to a third party. Simply put, this exception is that if the information concerns a third party (i.e. a party other than the information s eeker and the information provider), unless a public interest in disclosure is shown, information would not be W.P.(C) 803/2009 Page 11 of 16 given; information may also be refused on the ground that disclosure may result in unwarranted intrusion of privacy of the individual. Significan tly, the enactment makes no distinction between a private individual third party and a public servant or public official third party. 18. It is interesting to note that paradoxically, the right to privacy, recognized as a fundamental right by our Supreme Court, has found articulation – by way of a safeguard, though limited, against information disclosure, under the Information Act. In India, there is no law relating to data protection, or privacy; privacy rights have evolved through the interpretive proces s. The right to privacy, characterized by Justice Brandeis in his memorable dissent, in Olmstead v. United States , 277 US 438 (1928) as ""right to be let alone… the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilised men" has been recog nized under our Constitution by the Supreme Court in four rulings - Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. (1964) 1 SCR 332; Gobind v. State of M.P., (1975) 2 SCC 148; R. Rajagopal v. State of T.N., (1994) 6 SCC 632; and District Registrar and Collector v. Canara B ank, (2005) 1 SCC 496. None of these judgments, however explored the intersect between the two values of information rights and privacy rights; Rajagopal, which is nearest in point, was concerned to an extent with publication of material that was part of co urt records. 19. It has been held by a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court that an individual does not forfeit his fundamental rights, by becoming a public servant, in O.K. Ghosh v. E.X. Joseph AIR 1963 SC 812: W.P.(C) 803/2009 Page 12 of 16 “...the fundamental rights guaranteed by Art. 19 can be claimed by Government servants. Art. 33 which confers power on the parliament to modify the rights in their application to the Armed Forces, clearly brings out the fact that all citizens, including Government servants, are entitled to claim the rights guaranteed by Art. 19.” Earlier, in Kameshwar Prasad v. State of Bihar AIR 1962 1166, an argument that public servants do not possess certain fundamental rights, was repelled, by another Constitution Bench, categorically, in these terms: “It was said that a Government servant who was posted to a particular place could obviously not exercise the freedom to move throughout the territory of India and similarly, his right to reside and settle in any part of India could be said to be violated by his b eing posted to any particular place. Similarly, so long as he was in government service he would not be entitled to practice any profession or trade and it was therefore urged that to hold that these freedoms guaranteed under Art. 19 were applicable to gov ernment servants would render public service or administration impossible. This line of argument, however, does not take into account the limitations which might be imposed on the exercise of these rights by cls. (5) and (6) under which restrictions on the exercise of the rights conferred by sub -cls. (d) and (g) may be imposed if reasonable in the interest of the general public. 13. In this connection he laid stress on the fact that special provision had been made in regard to Service under the State in so me of the Articles in Part III - such as for instance Arts. 15, 16, and 18(3) and (4) - and he desired us therefrom to draw the inference that the other Articles in which there was no specific reference to Government servants were inapplicable to them. He realised however, that the implication arising from Art. 33 would run counter to this line of argument but as regards this Article his submission was that it was concerned solely to save Army Regulations which permitted detention in a manner which would no t be countenanced by Art. 22 of the Constitution. We find ourselves unable to accept the argument that the Constitution excludes Government servants as a class from the protection of the several rights guaranteed by the several Articles in Part III save in those cases where such persons were specifically named. 14. In our opinion, this argument even if otherwise possible, has to be repelled in view of the terms of Art. 33. That Article select two of the Services under the State -members of the armed forces charged with the maintenance of public order and saves the rules prescribing the conditions of service in regard to them - W.P.(C) 803/2009 Page 13 of 16 from invalidity on the ground of violation of any of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III and also defines the purpose for w hich such abrogation or restriction might take place, this being limited to ensure the proper discharge of duties and the maintenance of discipline among them. The Article having thus selected the Services members of which might be deprived of the benefit of the fundamental rights guaranteed to other persons and citizens and also having prescribed the limits within which such restrictions or abrogation might take place, we consider that other classes of servants of Government in common with other persons an d other citizens of the country cannot be excluded from the protection of the rights guaranteed by Part III by reason merely of their being Government servants and the nature and incidents of the duties which they have to discharge in that capacity might n ecessarily involve restrictions of certain freedoms as we have pointed out in relation to Art. 19(1)(e) and (g).” (emphasis supplied) 20. A bare consideration of the right of individuals, including public servants, to privacy would seem to suggest that pri vacy rights, by virtue of Section 8(1)(j) whenever asserted, would have to prevail. However, that is not always the case, since the public interest element, seeps through that provision. Thus when a member of the public requests information about a public servant, a distinction must be made between “official” information inherent to the position and those that are not, and therefore affect only his/her private life. This balancing task appears to be easy; but is in practice, not so, having regard to the dyn amics inherent in the conflict. Though it may be justifiably stated that protection of the public servant’s private or personal details as an individual, is necessary, provided that such protection does not prevent due accountability, there is a powerful c ounter argument that public servants must effectively waive the right to privacy in favour of transparency. Thus, if public access to the personal details such as identity particulars of public servants, i.e. details such as their dates of birth, personal identification numbers, or other personal information furnished to public agencies, is requested, the W.P.(C) 803/2009 Page 14 of 16 balancing exercise, necessarily dependant and evolving on case by case basis may take into account the following relevant considerations, i.e. i) whether the information is deemed to comprise the individual’s private details, unrelated to his position in the organization, and, ii) whether the disclosure of the personal information is with the aim of providing knowledge of the proper performance of the duti es and tasks assigned to the public servant in any specific case; iii) whether the disclosure will furnish any information required to establish accountability or transparency in the use of public resources . 21. An important and perhaps vital consideration , aside from privacy is the public interest element, mentioned previously. Section 8(1)(j)’s explicit mention of that concept has to be viewed in the context. In the context of the right to privacy, Lord Denning in his What next in Law, presciently said th at: "English law should recognise a right to privacy. Any infringement of it should give a cause of action for damages or an injunction as the case may require. It should also recognise a right of confidence for all correspondence and communications which expressly or impliedly are given in confidence. None of these rights is absolute. Each is subject to exceptions. These exceptions are to be allowed whenever the public interest in openness outweighs the public interest in privacy or confidentiality. In eve ry instance it is a balancing exercise for the Courts. As each case is decided, it will form a precedent for others. So a body of case -law will be established." 22. A private individual’s right to privacy is undoubtedly of the same order as that of a public servant. Therefore, it would be wrong to assume that the substantive rights of the two differ. Yet, inherent in the situation of the latter is the premise that he acts for the public good, in the discharge of his duties, and is accounta ble for them. The character of protection, W.P.(C) 803/2009 Page 15 of 16 therefore, which is afforded to the two classes – public servants and private individuals, has to be viewed from this perspective. The nature of restriction on the right to privacy is therefore of a different orde r; in the case of private individuals, the degree of protection afforded is greater; in the case of public servants, the degree of protection can be lower, depending on what is at stake. Therefore, if an important value in public disclosure of personal inf ormation is demonstrated, in the particular facts of a case, the protection afforded by Section 8(1)(j) may not be available; in such case, the information officer can proceed to the next step of issuing notice to the concerned public official, as a “third party” and consider his views on why there should be no disclosure. The onus of showing that disclosure should be made, is upon the individual asserting it; he cannot merely say that as the information relates to a public official, there is a public inter est element. Adopting such a simplistic argument would defeat the object of Section 8(1)(j); the legislative intention in carving out an exception from the normal rule requiring no “locus” by virtue of Section 6, in the case of exemptions, is explicit thro ugh the non-obstante clause. The court is also unpersuaded by the reasoning of the Bombay High Court, which appears to have given undue, even overwhelming deference to Parliamentary privilege (termed “plenary” by that court) in seeking information, by virt ue of the proviso to Section 8(1)(j). Were that the true position, the enactment of Section 8(1)(j) itself is rendered meaningless, and the basic safeguard bereft of content. The proviso has to be only as confined to what it enacts, to the class of informa tion that Parliament can ordinarily seek; if it were held that all information relating to all public servants, even private information, can be accessed by Parliament, Section 8(1)(j) would be devoid of any substance, because the provision makes no W.P.(C) 803/2009 Page 16 of 16 distin ction between public and private information. Moreover there is no law which enables Parliament to demand all such information; it has to be necessarily in the context of some matter, or investigation. If the reasoning of the Bombay High Court were to be a ccepted, there would be nothing left of the right to privacy, elevated to the status of a fundamental right, by several judgments of the Supreme Court. 23. As discussed earlier, the “public interest” argument of the Petitioner is premised on the plea that his wife is a public servant; he is in litigation with her, and requires information, - in the course of a private dispute – to establish the truth of his allegations. The CIC has held that there is no public interest element in the disclosure of such per sonal information, in the possession of the information provider, i.e. the Indian Air Force. This court concurs with the view, on an application of the principles discussed. The petitioner has, not been able to justify how such disclosure would be in “publ ic interest” : the litigation is, pure and simple, a private one. The basic protection afforded by virtue of the exemption (from disclosure) enacted under Section 8(1)(j) cannot be lifted or disturbed. 24. In view of the above discussion, the writ petitio n fails, and is dismissed. In the circumstances of the case, there shall be no order on costs. S.

Whether the judgment should be reported in Digest? Yes O R D E R 07.02.2011 1. The Petitioner Indian Institute of Technology („IIT‟), Delhi is aggrieved by orders dated 23rd November 2010 and 23rd December 2 010 passed by the Central Information Commission („CIC‟) in the complaints of Mr. Navin Talwar [ the Respondent in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 747 of 2011) and Mr. Sushil Kohli [ the Respondent in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 751 of 2011) , Writ Petition (Civil) Nos. 747/2011 & 751/2011 Page 2 of 7 respectively. 2. The issue involved in both these petitions is more or less similar. Mr. Navin Talwar sat for the Joint Entrance Examination 2010 („JEE 2010‟). Mr. Sushil Kohli‟s daughter , Ms. Sakshi Kohli , sat for the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering 2010 („GATE 2010‟) . The scheme of the examination is that the candidates are given two question papers, containing multiple choices for the correct answers, the correct answers are to be darkened by a pencil in the Optical Response Sheet („ORS‟) which is supplied to the cand idates. The candidate has to darken the bubble s corresponding to the correct answer in an ORS against the relevant question number. 3. The JEE 2010 was conducted on 11th April 2010 in 1026 centres across India and 4.72 lakh candidates appeared. The answ er key was placed on the internet website of the IIT on 3rd June 2010 while the individual marks of the candidates were posted on 5th June 2010. Counseling of the successful candidates took place from 9th to 12th June 2010. The GATE 2010 was conducted on 1 4th February 2010 and the results were announced on 15th March 2010. 4. In the information brochure, for the JEE, one of the terms and conditions reads as under: “X. Results of JEE -2010 1. Performance in JEE -2010 The answer paper of JEE -2010 is a mac hine-gradable Optical Response Sheet (ORS). These sheets are scrutinized and graded Writ Petition (Civil) Nos. 747/2011 & 751/2011 Page 3 of 7 with extreme care after the examination. There is no provision for re-grading and re -totalling. No photocopies of the machine - gradable sheets will be made available. No cor respond ence in this regard will be entertained. Candidates will get to know their All India Ranks („AIR‟)/Category ranks through our website/SMS/VRS on May 26, 2010. Candidates can view their performance in JEE -2010 from JEE websites from June 3, 2010. ” A similar clause is contained in Clause 3.5.1 (d) of the brochure for GATE. 5. It is stated that despite the abov e condition, Mr. Navin Talwar [ the Respondent in W.P. (Civil) No. 747 of 2011] and Mr. Sushil Kohli (father) [the Respondent in W.P. (Civil ) No. 751 of 2011] filed application s under the Right to Information Act, 2005 („RTI Act‟) with the Public Information Officer („PIO‟), IIT seeking the photocop ies of the respective ORS s and for the subject -wise marks of each of the candidates. 6. The PI O of IIT responded by stating that the marks obtained by the candidates were available on the internet and there was no provision for providing a photocopy of the ORS. Thereafter, the Respondents filed appeals before the CIC. After perusing the response of the PIO, IIT , the CIC passed the following order in the appeal filed by Mr. Navin Talwar: “3. Upon perusal of the documents of the case, the Commission finds that the response of the Public Authority is not found acceptable by the Complainant. Hence, des pite the information provided by the letter dated 15th June 2010, the Complainant approached this Commission. The Commission Writ Petition (Civil) Nos. 747/2011 & 751/2011 Page 4 of 7 suggests the Complainant to seek inspection of the relevant records and direct s Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi to cooperate with the Complainant in the inspection of the file/s. It is also directed that the Respondent shall submit a duly notari sed affidavit on a Non -judicial stamp paper stating the inability to furnish the copy of ORS. The Complainant is at liberty to approach the appropriate Grievance Redressal Forum or seek legal remedy.” 7. As regards the case of Mr. Sushil Kohli the Commission found that the defence of the IIT was that “the information sought is exempted under Section 8 (1) (e) since GATE Committee shares f iduciary relationship with its evaluators and maintains confidentiality of both the manner and method of evaluation.” It was further contended before the CIC that “the evaluation of the ORS is carried out by a computerized p rocess using scanning machines.” The decision rendered on 23rd December 2010 in the appeal filed by Mr. Sushil Kohli reads as under: “2. During the hearing, the Respondent stated that they have to inform the NCB, MHRD before handing over the marks to the Appellant and that the process w ould take more than a month. The Commission in consultation with the Appellant agreed to give additional time to the PIO for providing the information and accordingly directs the PIO to provide the marks sheet to the Appellant within 45 days from the date of hearing to the Appellant.” 8. This Court has heard the submissions of Mr. Arjun Mitra, learned counsel appearing for the Petitioner IIT. It is first submitted that as regards Mr. Navin Talwar‟s case, severe prejudice has been caused to the Petitioner because the decision of the CIC has been rendered without affording the IIT an opportunity of being heard. Writ Petition (Civil) Nos. 747/2011 & 751/2011 Page 5 of 7 9. This Court is not impressed with the above submission. The defence the Petitioner may have had , if a notice had been issued to it by the CIC , has been considered by this Court in the present proceeding s. This Court finds, for the reasons explained hereinafter, that there is no legal justification for the Petitioner‟s refusal to provide each of the Respondents a photocopy of the concerned ORS. 10. It is next submitted that under Section 8 (1) (e) of the RTI Act, there is a fiduciary relationship that the Petitioner shares with the evaluators and therefore a photocopy of the ORS cannot be disclosed. Reliance is placed on the decision by the Full Be nch of the CIC rendered on 23rd April 2007 in Rakesh Kumar Singh v. Harish Chander. 11. In the first place given the fact that admittedly the evaluation of the ORS is carried out through a computerized process and not manually, the question of there bein g a fiduciary relationship between the I IT and the evaluators does not arise. Secondly, a perusal of the decision of the CI C in Rakesh Kumar Singh v. Harish Chander shows that a distinction was drawn by the CIC between the O MR sheets and conventional answe r sheets. The evaluation of the ORS is done by a computerized process. The non -ORS answer sheets are evaluated by physical marking. I t was observed in para 41 that where OMR (or ORS) sheets are used , as in the present cases, the disclosure of evaluated an swer sheets was “unlikely to render the system unworkable and as such the evaluated answer sheets in such cases will be disclosed and made available under the Right to Information Act unless the Writ Petition (Civil) Nos. 747/2011 & 751/2011 Page 6 of 7 providing of such answer sheets would involve an infringement of copyright as provided for under Section 9 of the Right to Information Act.” 12. Irrespective of the decision dated 23rd April 2007 of the CIC in Rakesh Kumar Singh v. Harish Chander , which in any event is not binding on this Court , it is obvious tha t the evaluation of the ORS/ORM sheets is through a computerized process and no prejudice can be caused to the IIT by providing a candidate a photocopy of the concerned ORS. This is not information being sought by a third party but by the candidate himself or herself. The disclosure of such photocopy of the ORS will not compromise the identity of the evaluator , since the evaluation is done through a computerized process. There is no question of defence under Section 8 (1) (e) of the RTI Act being invoked by the IIT to deny copy of such OM R sheets/ ORS to the candidate. 13. It is then urged by Mr. Mitra that if the impugned orders of the CIC are sustained it would open a “floodgate ” of such applications by other candidates as a result of which the entire JEE and GATE system would “collapse ”. The above apprehension is exaggerated. If IIT is confident that both the JEE and GATE are fool proof, it should have no difficulty providing a candidate a copy of his or her ORS. It enhances transparency. It appears unlike ly that the each and every candidate would want photocopies of the ORS. 14. It is then submitted that evaluation done of the ORS by the Petitioner is final and no request can be entertained for re -evaluation of marks. Reliance is placed on the order date d 2nd July 2010 passed by the learned Single Judge Writ Petition (Civil) Nos. 747/2011 & 751/2011 Page 7 of 7 of this Court in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3807 of 2010 [Adha Srujana v. Union of India ]. This Court finds that the question as far as the present case is concerned is not about the request of the Responde nts for re -evaluation or re-totalling of the marks obtained by them in the JEE 2010 or GATE 2010 . Notwithstanding the disclosure of the ORS to the Respondent, IIT would be within its rights to decline a request from either of them for re-evaluation or re-totalling in terms of the conditions already set out in the information brochure. The decision d ated 2nd July 2010 by this Court in W .P. (C) No. 3807 of 2010 has no application to the present case. 15. The right of a candidate, sitting for JEE or GATE, to obtain information under the RTI Act is a statutory one. It cannot be said to have been waived by such candidate only because of a clause in the information brochure for the JEE or GATE. In other words, a candidate does not lose his or her right under the RTI Act only because he or she has agreed to sit for JEE or GATE. The condition in the brochure that no photocopy of the ORS sheet will be provided , is subject to the RTI Act. It cannot override the RTI Act. 16. For the above reasons, this Court finds no reason to interfere with the impugned orders dated 23rd November 2010 and 23rd December 2010 passed by the CIC. 17. The writ petitions and the pending applications are dismissed. S. MURALIDHAR, J FEBRUARY 07, 2011 rk W.P. (Civil) 12428 /2009 Page 1 of 3 $~ * IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI 10 + W.P.(C) 12428/2009 & CM APPL 12874/2009 DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF POLICE ..... Petitioner Through Mr. Pawan Sharma, Standing counsel with Mr. Sanjay Lao, APP and Mr. Laxmi Chauh an, Advocate along with SI Anil Kumar, Anti Corruption Branch versus D.K.SHARMA ..... Respondent In person. CORAM: JUSTICE S. MURALIDHAR O R D E R % 15.12.2010 1. The Deputy Commissioner of Police, Anti Corruption Branch (‘DCP’) is aggrieved by an order dated 25th September 2009 passed by the Central Information Commission (‘CIC’) directing the Petitioner DCP to provide to the Respondent copies of the documents so ught by him. These documents include certified copies of D.D. entry of arrest of the Respondent and various other documents relating to the investigation of the case, under FIR No. 52 of 2003. The CIC found the denial of the information by the Petitioner b y taking recourse of Section 8 (1) of the Right to Information Act, 2005 (‘RTI Act’) to be untenable. It was held that none of the clauses under Section 8 (1) covered subjudice matters and therefore, the information could not be denied. 2. This Court has heard the submissions of Mr. Pawan Sharma, learned counsel appearing for the Petitioner, and the Respondent who appears in W.P. (Civil) 12428 /2009 Page 2 of 3 person. 3. Mr. Pawan Sharma referred to Section 172 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (‘CrPC’) and submitted that copies of the case diary can be used by a criminal court conducting the trial and could not be used as evidence in the case. He submitted that even the accused was not entitled, as a matter of right, to a case diary in terms of Section 172 (2) CrPC and that the provisions of the RTI Act have to be read subject to Section 172 (2) CrPC. Secondly, it is submitted that the trial has concluded and the Respondent has been convicted. All documents relied upon by the prosecution in the trial were provided to the Responden t under Section 208 CrPC. The Respondent could have asked for the documents sought by him while the trial was in progress before the criminal court. He could not be permitted to invoke the RTI Act after the conclusion of the trial. 4. The Respondent who appears in person does not dispute the fact that the trial court has convicted him. He states that an appeal has been filed which is pending. He submits that his right to ask for documents concerning his own case in terms of the RTI Act was not subject to any of the provisions of the CrPC. Finally, it is submitted that no prejudice would be caused to the Petitioner at this stage, when the trial itself has concluded if the documents pertaining to the investigation are furnished to the Respondent. 5. The a bove submissions have been considered. 6. This Court is inclined to concur with the view expressed by the CIC that in W.P. (Civil) 12428 /2009 Page 3 of 3 order to deny the information under the RTI Act the authority concerned would have to show a justification with reference to one of the specific clauses under Section 8 (1) of the RTI Act. In the instant case, the Petitioner has been unable to discharge that burden. The mere fact that a criminal case is pending may not by itself be sufficient unless there is a specific power to deny disclo sure of the information concerning such case. In the present case, the criminal trial has concluded. Also, the investigation being affected on account of the disclosure information sought by the Respondent pertains to his own case. No prejudice can be caus ed to the Petitioner if the D.D. entry concerning his arrest, the information gathered during the course of the investigation, and the copies of the case diary are furnished to the Respondent. The right of an applicant to seek such information pertaining t o his own criminal case, after the conclusion of the trial, by taking recourse of the RTI Act, cannot be said to be barred by any provision of the CrPC. It is required to be noticed that Section 22 of the RTI Act states that the RTI Act would prevail notwi thstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in the Official Secrets Act, 1923 and any other law for the time being in force. 7. Consequently, this Court is not inclined to interfere with the impugned order dated 25th September 2009 passed by the CIC. 8. The petition and the pending application are dismissed.

YES SANJIV KHANNA, J.: 1. Mr. Rajinder Jaina -petitioner seeks issue of Writ of Certiorari for quashing of Order dated 2nd March, 2009 passed by the Central Information Commission (hereinafter referred to as CIC, for short) directing disclosure of the following information : - “1. List of all complain ts filed against Mr.Rajinder Jaina alias Rajender Jain alias Mr.Rajender Jaina S/o.T.C. Jain r/o. Flat „P‟, Sagar Apartments, G. Tilak Marg, New Delhi -WPC No.8524/2009 Page 2 110001, office at N -52A, Connaught Circus, New Delhi -110001. 2. All FIR‟s filed against the above named person along with ATR and current status. 3.

Period for which information asked for : From 1980 till date.” 3. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that disclosure of information mentioned above is an unwarranted invasion on the right to privacy of the petitioner and is contrary to Section 8 (1)(j) of the Right to Information Act, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as Act , for short). 4. Right to privacy has been a subject matter and reiterated in the State of Andhra Pradesh and District Registrar and Collector, Hyderabad and another versus Canara Bank and others (2005) 1 SCC 496 . However, the said right is not an absolute right. Right to information is a part of Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression. Section 8(1)(j) of the Act balances right to privacy and right to information. It recognizes that both rights are important and require protection and in case of conflict between the two rights, the test of over -riding public interest is applied to decide whether information should be withh eld or disclosed. WPC No.8524/2009 Page 3 5. Section 8 (i)(j) of the A ct, stands interpreted by Ravindra Bhat, J. in The CPIO, Supreme Court of India, Tilak Marg, New Delhi versus Subhash Chandra Agarwal & another (Writ Petition No. 288/2009) decided on 2nd September, 2009. It has been held as under: - “66. It could arguably be said that that privacy rights, by virtue of Section 8(1)(j) whenever asserted, would prevail. However, that is not always the case, since the public interest element, seeps through that provision . Thus when a member of the public requests perso nal information about a public servant, - such as asset declarations made by him - a distinction must be made between the personal data inherent to the position and those that are not, and therefore affect only his/her private life. This balancing task appe ars to be easy; but is in practice, not so, having regard to the dynamics inherent in the conflict. If public access to the personal data containing details, like photographs of public servants, personal particulars such as their dates of birth, personal i dentification numbers, or other personal information furnished to public agencies, is requested, the balancing exercise, necessarily dependant and evolving on a case by case basis, would take into account of many factors which would require examination, ha ving regard to circumstances of each case. These may include: i) whether the disclosure of the personal information is with the aim of providing knowledge of the proper performance of the duties and tasks assigned to the public servant in any specific cas e; ii)whether the information is deemed to comprise the individual ‟s private details, unrelated to his position in the organization, and, WPC No.8524/2009 Page 4 iii) whether the disclosure will furnish any information required to establish accountability or transparency in the use of public resources. Section 8(1)(j)‟s explicit mention of privacy,therefore,has to be viewed in the context. Lord Denning in his “ What next in Law ”, presciently emphasized the need to suitably balance the competing values, as follows: "English law s hould recognise a right to privacy. Any infringement of it should give a cause of action for damages or an injunction as the case may require. It should also recognise a right of confidence for all correspondence and communications which expressly or impliedly are given in confidence. None of these rights is absolute. Each is subject to exceptions. These exceptions are to be allowed whenever the public interest in openness outweighs the public interest in privacy or confidentiality. In every instance i t is a balancing exercise for the Courts. As each case is decided, it will form a precedent for others. So a body of case -law will be established." 67. A private citizen ‟s privacy right is undoubtedly of the same nature and character as that of a public servant. Therefore, it would be wrong to assume that the substantive rights of the two differ. Yet, inherent in the situation of the latter is the premise that he acts for the public good, in the discharge of his duties, and is accountable for them. The character of protection, therefore, afforded to the two classes – public servants and private individuals, is to be viewed from this perspective. The nature of restriction on the right to privacy is therefore of a different order; in the case of private individuals, the degree of protection afforded is greater; in the case of public servants, the degree of protection can be lower, depending on what is at WPC No.8524/2009 Page 5 stake. Therefore, if an important value in public disclosure of personal information is demonstrated, in the particular facts of a case, by way of objective material or evidence, furnished by the information seeker, the protection afforded by Section 8(1)(j) may not be available; in such case, the information officer can proceed to the next step of issuing noti ce to the concerned public official,as a “third party ”and consider his views on why there should be no disclosure. The onus of showing that disclosure should be made, is upon the individual asserting it; he cannot merely say that as the information relate s to a public official, there is a public interest element . Adopting such a simplistic argument would defeat the objective of Section 8(1)(j); Parliamentary intention in carving out an exception from the normal rule requiring no “locus ” by virtue of Secti on 6,in the case of exemptions, is explicit through the non-obstante clause. ” 6. In the present case, the CIC has applied the same “test of public interest ” to determine and decide whether the information sought should be disclosed or disclosure will amount to unwarranted invasion of right to privacy. 7. It may be noted here that the information sought for by respondent no.2 relates to criminal complaints filed against the petitioner , FIRs registered against him, their current status and whether warrants w ere issued against some persons, police reports on execution of warrants and their current status. The aforesaid information is already as observed by the C IC, part of public records including court records. It is obvious and admitted WPC No.8524/2009 Page 6 that complaints are pending and FIRs have been registered and the same have been filed with the criminal court. Issue of arrest warrants and submissions of reports thereon also form part of the court records. It may be relevant to state here that the petition er himself has admitted that he has disputes with various parties and litigations are pending. He has also given details of some of the FIRs registered against him in the Writ Petition itself. It may be appropriate here to reproduce the ratio as expounded by the Supreme Court in Raj Gopal versus State of Andhra Pradesh (1994) 6 SCC 632 which reads as under: “(1) A citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, childbearing and education among other matters. (2) None can publish anything concerning the above matters without his consent – whether truthful or otherwise and whether laudatory or critical. If he does so, he would be violating the right to privacy of the person concerned. But a publication concerning the above aspects becomes unobjectionable, if such publication is based upon public records including court records. Once something becomes a matter of public record, the right of privacy no longer exists. The only exception to this could be in the interest of decency . (3) In the case of public officials, it is obvious that right of privacy or for that matter, remedy of action for damages is simply not available with respect to their acts and conducts relevant to the discharge of their official duties. This is so even wh ere the publication is based upon the acts and statements that are not true unless the official establishes that WPC No.8524/2009 Page 7 the publication was made with reckless disregard for truth. (4) So far as the Government, local authority or other organization and institutio n exercising governmental power are concerned, they cannot maintain suit for damages for defaming them.” (emphasis supplied) In view of the aforesaid, I do not find any merit in the present Writ Petition and the same is dismissed. (SANJIV KHAN NA) JUDGE NOVEM BER 4th , 2009 . P W.P(C) No. 5959 of 201 3 Page 1 of 3 * IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI Judg ement pronounced on :16.09.2013 + W.P.(C) 5959 of 2013 DIRECTORATE GENERAL OF SECURITY AND ANR ..... Petitioners Through: Mr. Ruchir Mishra & Mr. Sanj iv Saxena, Advs. versus HARENDER ..... Respondent Through: Mr. Shanmuga Patro, Adv. with Respondent in person. CORAM: HON‟BLE MR. JUSTICE V.K. JAIN V.K. JAIN, J. The respondent before this Court is working with Aviation Research Centre, which is part of the Cabinet Secretariat. The respondent applied to the CPIO of the Cabinet Secretariat seeking photocopies of the proceedings and minutes of the DCPs held from 2000 to 2009 including of the file notings and correspondence led to the above -referred DPCs. The CPIO of the Cabinet Secretariat responded by claiming that the Right to Information Act, 2005 (for short „RTI Act‟) did not apply to the Cabinet Secretariat. EA -II Section, since it was included in the Second Schedule appended to the RTI Act. The view taken by the CPIO was also maintained by the first appellate authority. Being aggrieved the respondent approached the Central Information Commission (for short „CIC‟) by way of a second appeal. Allowing the appeal the CIC inter alia held as under: W.P(C) No. 5959 of 201 3 Page 2 of 3 “4. During the hearing, the Respondents reiterated the same arguments. It is a fact that the public authority from which the information has been sought has been included in the second schedule. Ordinarily, the provisions of the Right to Informati on (RTI) Act would apply to it. However, in terms of first proviso to Section 24 (1) of the RTI Act, all information relating to the allegations of corruption and human rights violation will be provided. In this case, the Appellant, a member of the Sched ule Caste alleged that the public authority has been extremely unfair to him in respect of his promotion and that it denied him promotion for a long period of time without explaining him the reasons thereby violating his human right. In the special circum stances, of this case wherein the information seeker is a member of the SC community alleging to have been deprived of his rights in a matter of promotion in the job place, we are inclined to treat this case as covered by the proviso to Section 24 (1) of t he RTI Act and allow the information to be disposed. We, therefore, direct the CPIO to provide to the Appellant the desired information within 10 working days from the receipt of this order.” 2. Being aggrieved from the order of the CIC, Directorate Gene ral of Security, Office of Director, Aviation Research Centre and CPIO of the Cabinet Secretariat are before this Court by way of this writ petition. 3. Section 24 of the RTI Act to the extent it is relevant reads as under: “24. Act not to apply to certain organizations. – (1) Nothing contained in this Act shall apply to the intelligence and security organisations specified in the Second Schedule, being organisations established by the Central Government or any information furnished by such organisations to that Government. Provided that the information pertaining to the allegations of corruption and human rights violations shall not be excluded under this sub -section:” 4. A perusal of the Second Schedule which enumerates the intelligence and security org anisations established by the Central Government which are in Section 24 of the Act would show that Aviation Research Centre is W.P(C) No. 5959 of 201 3 Page 3 of 3 included in the said list at serial No.7. Admittedly the respondent was working in the Aviation Research Centre only. Therefor e, the provisions of the RTI Act would not apply to the aforesaid organisation except in the matters relating to allegations of corruption and human rights violation. The information sought by the petitioner pertained to various DPCs held from 2000 to 200 9 and such information is neither an information related to allegations of corruption nor to human rights violation. No violation of human rights is involved in service matters, such as promotion, disciplinary actions, pay increments, retiral benefits, pe nsion, gratuity, etc. The Commission, therefore, was clearly wrong in directing supply of said information to the respondent. 5. For the reasons stated hereinabove the impugned order dated 29.3.2011 of the CIC is quashed. However, it is made clear that q uashing of the aforesaid order will not come in the way of the respondent availing of such remedy as are open to him under the service law applicable to him or any other law, for the time being in force, for ventilation of his grievance. The writ petition stands disposed of. SEPTEMBER 16, 2013 V.K.

The issue involved in these petitions as to whether the copies of office notings recorded on the file of UPSC and the correspondence exch anged between UPSC and the Department seeking its advice can be accessed, by the person to whom such advice relates, in RTI Act or not. The respondent in W.P(C) No. 4079/2013 sought information from the CPIO of the petitioner – Union Public Service Commis sion (hereinafter referred to as “UPSC”) , with respect to the advice given by the petitioner – UPSC to the Government of Maharashtra in respect of departmental proceedings against him. The CPIO having declined the information sought by the respondent, an a ppeal was preferred by him before the First Appellate Authority. Since the appeal filed by him was dismissed, the respondent approached the Central Information Commission (hereinafter referred to as “the Commission”) by way of a second appeal. Vide impugne d order dated 1.5.2013, the Commission rejected the contention of the petitioner – UPSC that the said information was exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1) (e), (g) & (j) of the Right to Information Act (the Act) and directed the petitioner to disclose the file notings relating to the matter in hand to the respondent, with liberty to the petitioner –UPSC to obliterate the name and designation of the officer who made the said notings. Being aggrieved, the petitioner – UPSC is before this Court by way of this writ petition. W.P.(C) No.4079/2013&connected petitions Page 3 of 15 2. The respondent in W.P(C) No.2/2013 sought the information from the petitioner – UPSC with respect to the advice given by it in respect of the disciplinary proceedings initiated against the said respondent. The said information hav ing been denied by the CPIO as well as the First Appellate Authority, the respondent approached the Commission by way of a second appeal. The Commission vide the impugned order dated 26.9.2012 directed the petitioner to provide , to the respondent , the phot ocopies of the relevant file after masking the signatures of the officers including other identity marks. Being aggrieved, the petitioner – UPSC is before this Court seeking quashing of the aforesaid order passed by the Commission. 3. In W.P(C) No. 5603/2 013, the respondent before this Court sought information with respect to the advice given by UPSC to the State of Haryana with respect to the disciplinary proceedings instituted against him. The said information having been refused by the CPIO and the Firs t Appellate Authority, he also approached the Commission by way of a second appeal. The Commission rejected the objections raised by the petitioner and directed disclosure of the file notings and the correspondence relating to the charge -sheet against the respondent. The petitioner being aggrieved from the said order is before this Court by way of this petition. 4. In W.P(C) No.8/2013, the respondent before this Court sought information with respect to the advice given by UPSC in a case of disciplinary pro ceedings instituted against him. The said information, however, was denied by the CPIO of UPSC. Feeling aggrieved, the respondent preferred an appeal before the First Appellate Authority. The W.P.(C) No.4079/2013&connected petitions Page 4 of 15 appeal, however, came to be dismissed. The respondent thereupon approached the Commission by way of a second appeal. The Commission vide the impugned order dated 26.9.2012 directed disclosure of the information to the respondent. The petitioner – UPSC is aggrieved from the aforesaid order passed by the Commission. 5. The learned counsel for the petitioner – UPSC Mr. Naresh Kaushik has assailed the order passed by the Commission on the following grounds (i) there is a fiduciary relationship between UPSC and the department which seeks its advice and the information provi ded by the Department is held by UPSC in tru st for it. The said information, therefore, is exempted from disclosure under Section 8(1)( e) of the Act (ii) the file notings and the correspondence s exchanged between UPSC and the department seeking its advice may contain information relating not only to the information seeker but also to other persons and departments and institutions , which , being personal information , is exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act (iii) the officer s who record the notings on the file of UPSC are mainly drawn on deputation from various departments. If their identity is disclosed, they may be subjected to violence, intimidation and harassment by the persons against whom an adverse note is recorded and if the said offi cer of UPSC, on repatriation to his parent department, happens to be posted under the person against whom an adverse noting was recorded by him, such an officer may be targeted and harassed by the person against whom the note was recorded. Such an informat ion, therefore, is exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)( g) of the Act and (iv) the notings recorded by UPSC officer on the file are only inputs given to the Commission to enable it to render an appropriate advice to the W.P.(C) No.4079/2013&connected petitions Page 5 of 15 concerned department and are no t binding upon the Commission. Therefore, such information is not really necessary for the employee who is facing departmental inquiry, since he is concerned only with the advice ultimately rendered by UPSC to his department and not that the noting meant f or consideration of the Commission. 6. Section 8(1) (e)( g) and (j) of the Act reads as under: “Section 8(1)(e) in The Right To Information Act, 2005 Exemption from disclosure of information. - (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen, - xxx (e) information available to a person in his fiduciary relationship, unless the competent authority is satisfied that the larger public interest warrants t he disclosure of such information; xxx (g) information, the disclosure of which would endanger the life or physical safety of any person or identify the source of information or assistance given in confidence for law enforcement or security purposes; ; xxx (j) information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information: Provided that the information which cannot be denied to the Parliament or a S tate Legislature shall not be denied to any person. ” 7. Fiduciary Relationship: W.P.(C) No.4079/2013&connected petitions Page 6 of 15 The question which arises for consideration is as to whether UPSC is placed in a fiduciary relationship vis -à-vis the department which seeks its advice and the information provided by the department is held by UPSC in trust for the said department or not. The expression „fiduciary relationship‟ came to be considered by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in Central Board of Secondary Education and Another versus Aditya Bandopadhyay & Ors. [Civil Appeal No.6454 of 2011] and the following view was taken: 21. The term `fiduciary' refers to a person having a duty to act for the benefit of another, showing good faith and condour, where such other person reposes trust and special confidenc e in the person owing or discharging the duty. The term `fiduciary relationship' is used to describe a situation or transaction where one person (beneficiary) places complete confidence in another person (fiduciary) in regard to his affairs, business or tr ansaction/s. The term also refers to a person who holds a thing in trust for another (beneficiary). The fiduciary is expected to act in confidence and for the benefit and advantage of the beneficiary, and use good faith and fairness in dealing with the ben eficiary or the things belonging to the beneficiary. If the beneficiary has entrusted anything to the fiduciary, to hold the thing in trust or to execute certain acts in regard to or with reference to the entrusted thing, the fiduciary has to act in confid ence and expected not to disclose the thing or information to any third party. There are also certain relationships where both the parties have to act in a fiduciary capacity treating the other as the beneficiary. Examples of these are: a partner vis -`-vis another partner and an employer vis -`-vis employee. An W.P.(C) No.4079/2013&connected petitions Page 7 of 15 employee who comes into possession of business or trade secrets or confidential information relating to the employer in the course of his employment, is expected to act as a fiduciary and cannot discl ose it to others. Similarly, if on the request of the employer or official superior or the head of a department, an employee furnishes his personal details and information, to be retained in confidence, the employer, the official superior or departmental h ead is expected to hold such personal information in confidence as a fiduciary, to be made use of or disclosed only if the employee's conduct or acts are found to be prejudicial to the employer. 22. ...the words `information available to a person in his fi duciary relationship' are used in section 8(1)(e) of RTI Act in its normal and well recognized sense, that is to refer to persons who act in a fiduciary capacity, with reference to a specific beneficiary or beneficiaries who are to be expected to be protec ted or benefited by the actions of the fiduciary - a trustee with reference to the beneficiary of the trust, a guardian with reference to a minor/physically/infirm/mentally challenged, a parent with reference to a child, a lawyer or a chartered accountant with reference to a client, a doctor or nurse with reference to a patient, an agent with reference to a principal, a partner with reference to another partner, a director of a company with reference to a share -holder, an executor with reference to a legate e, a receiver with reference to the parties to a lis, an employer with reference to the confidential information relating to the employee, and an employee with reference to business dealings/transaction of the employer. ..” W.P.(C) No.4079/2013&connected petitions Page 8 of 15 The aforesaid expression also came up for consideration of the Apex Court in Bihar Public Service Commission versus Saiyed Hussain Abbas Rizwi & Anr. [Civil Appeal No.9052 of 2012] and the following view was taken by the Apex Court: “22....The term „fiduciary‟ refers to a person havin g a duty to act for the benefit of another, showing good faith and condour, where such other person reposes trust and special confidence in the person owing or discharging the duty. The term „fiduciary relationship‟ is used to describe a situation or trans action where one person places complete confidence in another person in regard to his affairs, business or transactions. This aspect has been discussed in some detail in the judgment of this Court in the case of Central Board of Secondary Education (supra) . xxx 24...The information may come to knowledge of the authority as a result of disclosure by others who give that information in confidence and with complete faith, integrity and fidelity. Secrecy of such information shall be maintained, thus, bringing it within the ambit of fiduciary capacity ...” 8. The advice from UPSC is taken by the Disciplinary Authority, as a statutory requirement under the service rules applicable to an employee and wherever the Disciplinary Authority takes such an advice into c onsideration while recording its findings in the matter. The concerned employee is entitled to supply of such advice to him , as a matter of right . There is no relationship of master and agent or a client and advocate between the UPSC and the department wh ich seeks its advice. The information which the department provides to UPSC for the purpose of obtaining its advice normally would be the information pertaining to the employee against whom disciplinary proceedings have been initiated. Ordinarily such information would already be available W.P.(C) No.4079/2013&connected petitions Page 9 of 15 with the concerned employee having been supplied to him while seeking his explanation, along with the charge -sheet or during the course of the inquiry. The UPSC, while giving its advice, cannot take into consideration an y material, which is not available or is not to be made available to the concerned employee. Therefore, the notings of the officials of UPSC, would contain nothing, except the information which is already made available or is required to be made available to the concerned employee. Sometimes, such information can be a third party information, which qualifies to be personal information, within the meaning of clause (j), but, such information, can always be excluded, while responding to an application made to UPSC, under RTI Act. Therefore, when such information is sought by none other than the employee against whom disciplinary proceedings are sought to be initiated or are held , it would be difficult to accept the contention that there is a fiduciary relati onship between UPSC and the department seeking its advice or that the information pertaining to such an employee is held by UPSC in trust. Such a plea, in my view, can be taken only when the information is sought by someone other than the employee to whom the information pertains. 9. The learned counsel for the petitioner has referred to the decision of this Court in Ravinder Kumar versus CIC [LPA No.418/2008 3.5.2011. The aforesaid LP A arose out of a decision of the learned Single Judge of this Court in W .P(C) No. 2269/2011 decided on 5.4.2011, uph olding the directions of the Commission to UPSC to provide photocopies of the relevant file notings concerning of two disciplinary cases involving the respondent to him , after deleting the name and other reference to the individual officer/ authority. As noted W.P.(C) No.4079/2013&connected petitions Page 10 of 15 by a learned Single Judge of this Court in UPSC versus R.K. Jain [W.P(C) No.1243/2011 dated 13.7.2012, the order passed by the Division Bench was an order dismissing the application for restoration of the LPA and was not an order on merit and, therefore, it was not a decision on any legal proposition rendered by the Court on merit. It was further held that mere prima facie observation of the Division Bench does not constitute a binding precedent. Therefore, re liance upon the aforesaid order in LPA No.418/2010 is wholly misplaced. 10. As regards the applicability of clause (g), it would be seen that the said clause exempts information of two kinds from disclosure – the first being the information disclosure of which would endanger the life or physical safety of any person and second being the information which would identify the source of information or assistance given in confidence for law enforcement or security purpo ses. The two parts of the clause are independent of each other – meaning thereby that exemption from disclosure on account of danger to the life or physical safety of any person can be ground of exemption irrespective of who had given the information, who was the person , to whom the information was given, what was the purpose of giving information and what were the terms – expressed or implied subject to which the information was provided. The aforesaid clause came up for consideration before the Hon‟ble Su preme Court in Bihar Public Service Commission (supra) and the following view was taken: “28... The legislature, in its wisdom, has used two distinct expressions. They cannot be read or construed as being synonymous. Every expression used by the Legislature must be given its intended meaning and, in fact, a purposeful interpretation. The expression „life‟ has to be construed liberally. „Physical safety‟ is a W.P.(C) No.4079/2013&connected petitions Page 11 of 15 restricted term while life is a term of wide connotation. „Life‟ includes reputation of an individual as well as the right to live with freedom. The expression „ life‟ also appears in Article 21 of the Constitution and has been provided a wide meaning so as to inter alia include within its ambit the right to live with dignity, right to shelter, right to ba sic needs and even the right to reputation. The expression life under section 8(1(g) the Act, thus, has to be understood in somewhat similar dimensions. The term „endanger‟ or „endangerment‟ means the act or an instance of putting someone or something in d anger; exposure to peril or such situation which would hurt the concept of life as understood in its wider sense [refer Black‟s Law Dictionary (Eighth Edition)]. Of course, physical safety would mean the likelihood of assault to physical existence of a per son. If in the opinion of the concerned authority there is danger to life or possibility of danger to physical safety, the State Information Commission would be entitled to bring such case within the exemption of Section 8(1)(g) of the Act. The disclosure of information which would endanger the life or physical safety of any person is one category and identification of the source of information or assistance given in confidence for law enforcement or security purposes is another category. The expression „fo r law enforcement or security purposes‟ is to be read ejusdem generis only to the expression „assistance given in confidence‟ and not to any other clause of the section. On the plain reading of Section 8(1)(g), it becomes clear that the said clause is comp lete in itself. It cannot be said to have any reference to the expression „assistance given in confidence for law enforcement or security purposes‟. Neither the language of the Section nor the object of the Section requires such interpretation. ” 11. In my view, the apprehension of the petitioner that if the identity of the author of the file notings is revealed by his name, designation or in any other manner , there is a possibility of such an employee being targeted, harassed and even intimidate d by the persons against whom an W.P.(C) No.4079/2013&connected petitions Page 12 of 15 adverse noting is recorded by him on the file of UPSC , is fully justified . Though, ultimately it is for the members of the UPSC who are to accept or reject such notings, this can hardly be disputed that the notings do play a vital role in the advice which UPSC ultimately renders to the concerned department . Therefore, the person against whom an adverse advice is given may hold the employee of UPSC recording a note adverse to him on the file , responsible for an adverse advic e given by UPSC against him and may, therefore, harass and sometime even harm such an employee /officer of UPSC , directly or indirectly. To this extent, the officers of UPSC need to be protected. However, the purpose can be fully achieved by blocking the na me, designation o r any other indication which would disclose or tend to disclose the identity of the author of the noting. Denying the notings altogether would not be justified when the intended objective can be fully achieved by adopting such safeguards. 12. Personal Information As regards clause ( j), it would be difficult to dispute that the exemption cannot be claimed when the information is sought by none other than the person to whom the personal information relates. It is only when the information i s sought by a third party that such an exemption can be claimed by UPSC. If, the notings recorded on the file and/or the correspondence exchanged between UPSC and the concerned department do contain any such information which pertains to a person other tha n the information seeker and constitutes personal information within the meaning of section 8(1)(j), the UPSC was certainly be entitled to refuse such information on the ground that it is exempted from disclosure under clause 8(1)(j) of the Act. W.P.(C) No.4079/2013&connected petitions Page 13 of 15 13. As re gards the contention that the notings recorded by the employees of UPSC are not necessary for the information seeker since he is concerned with the ultimate opinion rendered by UPSC to his department and not with various notings which are recorded by the officer of the Commission , I find the same to be devoid of any merit. While seeking information under the Right to Information Act, the application is not required to disclose the purpose for which the information is sought nor is it necessary for him to sa tisfy the CPIO that the information sought by him was necessary for his personal purposes or for public purpose. Therefore, the question whether information seeker really needs the information is not relevant in the Scheme of the Act. The learned counsel for the petitioner drew my attention to the following observations made by the Apex Court in Central Board of Secondary Education and Another versus Aditya Bandopadhyay & Ors. (supra) : “37. The right to information is a cherished right. Information and r ight to information are intended to be formidable tools in the hands of responsible citizens to fight corruption and to bring in transparency and accountability. The provisions of RTI Act should be enforced strictly and all efforts should be made to bring to light the necessary information under clause (b) of section 4(1) of the Act which relates to securing transparency and accountability in the working of public authorities and in discouraging corruption. But in regard to other information,(that is inform ation other than those enumerated in section 4(1)(b) and (c) of the Act), equal importance and emphasis are given to other public interests (like confidentiality of sensitive information, fidelity and fiduciary W.P.(C) No.4079/2013&connected petitions Page 14 of 15 relationships, efficient operation of governm ents, etc.). Indiscriminate and impractical demands or directions under RTI Act for disclosure of all and sundry information (unrelated to transparency and accountability in the functioning of public authorities and eradication of corruption) would be coun ter- productive as it will adversely affect the efficiency of the administration and result in the executive getting bogged down with the non -productive work of collecting and furnishing information. The Act should not be allowed to be misused or abused, to become a tool to obstruct the national development and integration, or to destroy the peace, tranquility and harmony among its citizens. Nor should it be converted into a tool of oppression or intimidation of honest officials striving to do their duty. Th e nation does not want a scenario where 75% of the staff of public authorities spends 75% of their time in collecting and furnishing information to applicants instead of discharging their regular duties. The threat of penalties under the RTI Act and the pr essure of the authorities under the RTI Act should not lead to employees of a public authorities prioritising `information furnishing', at the cost of their normal and regular duties. ” However, when the file noting is sought by a person in respect of whom advice is rendered by UPSC cannot be said to be indiscriminate or all and sundry information , which would affect the functioning of UPSC. Such notings are available in the file in which advice is recorded by UPSC and, therefore, it would not at all be difficult to provide the same to the information seeker. W.P.(C) No.4079/2013&connected petitions Page 15 of 15 For the reasons stated hereinabove, the writ petitions are disposed of with the following directions: - (i) the copies of office notings recorded in the file of UPSC as well as the copies of the correspondence exchanged between UPSC and the Department by which its advice was sought , to the extent it was sought, shall be provided to the respondent after removing from the notings and correspondence , (a) the date of the noting and the letter, as the case may be; (b) the name and designation of the person recording the noting and writing the letter and; (c) any other indication in the noting and/or correspondence which may reveal or tend to reveal the identity of author of the noting/letter , as the ca se may be ; (ii) if the notings and/or correspondence referred in (i) above contains personal information relating to a third party, such information will be excluded while providing the information sought by the respondent; (iii) the information in terms o f this order shall be provided within four weeks from today.

Respondent Through Mr. Prashant Bhushan with Mr. Pranav Sachdeva, Advocate CORAM: JUSTICE S.MURALIDHAR O R D E R 29.09.2010 1. The challenge in this petition is to an order dated 14th September 2009 passed by the Central Information Commission (?CIC?) allowing the appeal filed by the Respondent and directing the information sought by the Respondent to be provided to him by the Petitioner by 5th October 2009 by using the severance clause 10 (1) of the Right to Information Act, 2005 (?RTI Act?). 2. The Respondent filed an application with the Ministry of External Affairs (?MEA?) on 16th September 2008 about the action taken report (?ATR?) on a complaint made to the Central Vigilance Commission (?CVC?) on 13th April 2007. Apparently the said complaint was forwarded by the CVC to the Central Vigilance Officer (?CVO?), MEA. The CVO submitted the ATR to the CVC on 24th July 2007. In this connection, the Respondent requested certified copies of the following documents: ?(a) copies of all departmental notings including recorded by CVO/Inquiry Officer/Cadre Controlling Authority/Disciplinary Authority/any other official(s), if any. (b) copies of all correspondences between Department and alleged officer(s)/other officer(s) pertaining to the matter but excluding copies of complaint. (c) copies of all notes recorded upon oral inquiry.? 5/22/2018 delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=172732&yr=2010 http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=172732&yr=2010 2/5 3. On 11th November 2008 the Central Public Information Officer (?CPIO?), MEA wrote to the Respondent declining the information under Section 8(i)(j) of the RTI Act. The first appeal filed by the Respondent was rejected by the Appellate Authority of the MEA on 5th October 2008, concurring with the reasoning of the CPIO. The Respondent then filed a second appeal before the CIC. 4. Before the CIC the Respondent explained that the complaint was about certain incidents of alleged misuse of government money in the Embassy of India, Ankara, Turkey in March 2007. The Respondent had come to know that in the ATR submitted, the CPIO had held that most of the allegations were baseless and that some procedural error might have occurred but without any financial loss to the Government. The CPIO accordingly opined that the matter should be closed by the CVC. On the basis of the ATR, the CVC decided not to further proceed with the matter. The Respondent urged that it was a right of a citizen to know the action the concerned public authority had taken on the complaint made to it. 5. At the hearing on 18th May 2009, the CIC held that there was no merit in the CPIO?s denial of information as ?personal information? by invoking Section 8 (1)(j) of the RTI Act since ?the public interest in this case far outweighs any harm done to protected interests.? Accordingly, the CPIO was directed to provide all the information sought by the Respondent in his RTI application by 15th June 2009 under intimation to the Commission. 6. Thereafter, the CIC received a letter dated 15th June 2009 from the CPIO, MEA seeking review of its order 18th May 2009 in view of the objection raised by the ?Third Party? i.e. the Ambassador of India at Turkey during the relevant time. The MEA invoked the provisions of Section 11 of the RTI Act. Notice was sent to the Ambassador for the hearing on 17th August 2009. On that hearing the CVO file containing the enquiry report and other relevant documents were brought in a sealed cover to the office of the CIC. These were inspected by the Commissioner and returned to the representative of the MEA. The Ambassador was heard by the CIC on 28th August 2009. She also produced a few documents before the CIC clarifying the complaint against her and about the outcome of the investigation. 7. It was contended before the CIC by the representative of the MEA that since the information sought related to a case which had been closed after completion of the enquiry, the disclosure of the information sought would indicate ?lack of confidence in the investigations conducted by the MEA and the CVC.? The CIC rejected this contention on the ground that ?neither the RTI Act 2005 nor any other law in force in India states that information pertaining to a closed case cannot be disclosed.? 8. Thereafter, the CIC in the impugned order has set out the observations upon the inspection of the enquiry report and the notings from the file of the CVO. Most of the allegations have been found to be baseless and therefore, with the approval of the Foreign Secretary, and in view of the categorical report from the CVO, the CVC concurred in not pursuing the matter further. According to the5/22/2018 delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=172732&yr=2010 http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=172732&yr=2010 3/5 enquiry report, there were administrative procedural lapses, which however had not led to any loss to the government. Nevertheless, the same had been noted by the concerned officials for rectification and future compliance. 9. The impugned order of the CIC also notes that the CVO file was once again perused by the CIC on 28th August 2009. The observations of the CIC on the further examination are as under: ?The contents of the CVO file inspected by the Commission clearly indicate that the information therein are not by any stretch of imagination ?personal information? pertaining to the Ambassador. The allegations cast as well as the inquiry/investigation conducted were related to the Ambassador in her ?official capacity? and dealt with alleged complaints about misappropriation of government money. The transactions with respect to government money is anyway liable for a government audit, which has been noted even during the investigation by various officials, so there can be no confidentiality and/or secrecy in divulging such information since the expenditure of government money by a government official in the official capacity as office expenses cannot be termed/categorized as ?personal information?. 10. An apprehension was expressed by the MEA before the CIC that: ?the disclosure of such classified information could adversely impact the morale of the members of the Ministry. The Respondent expressed his apprehension that the distortion and/or improper reporting of the order declaring such disclosure of information, by the media, in order to make the same sensational, may damage the image and reputation of such a senior official as well as the Ministry. Hence the Ministry, the Commission from disclosure of the information categorizing the said information as ?personal information?. 11. The CIC negatived this apprehension by observing that : ?In the instant case the disclosure of information relating to alleged charges of corruption and misappropriation of government money, wherein after a detailed investigation/ inquiry, the name and reputation of the public official concerned, had been declared unblemished, is actually crucial in strengthening the public faith in the functioning of the Ministry and the CVC. Since the allegation and/or complaint, vigilance enquiry and the enquiry reports were in respect of the Ambassador in her official capacity and related to her office and acts/omissions therein and also because all the information sought by the Appellant exists in official records already, hence the information cannot be classified as personal nor exemption be sought on that ground.? 12. As far as the distortion of the CIC orders in the hands of the media is concerned, it was held that it could not be a ground for not disclosing the information. The CIC specifically dealt with the aspect of public interest in ordering disclosure of information pertaining to a third party under Section 11 of the RTI Act. The CIC observed as under:5/22/2018 delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=172732&yr=2010 http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=172732&yr=2010 4/5 ?In this contention it is important to remember that the public interest has to be established in case the information sought otherwise merits non-disclosure, falling within one of the exempted categories and not vice versa. It has amply been discussed in the foregoing paragraphs that since the information sought relates to allegations of misappropriation of government money, public money being at stake, the information cannot be considered as personal information and hence the information does not fall under provisions of Section 8 (1) (j) of the RTI Act 2005.? 13. Consequently, the CIC directed that: ?the information as sought by the Appellant be provided by 5th October 2009, while using the severance clause 10 (1) of the RTI Act, if required, to severe parts exempted from disclosure in the enquiry report, under intimation to the Commission.? 14. The submissions of Mr. Abhinav Rao, learned counsel appearing for the Petitioner and Mr. Prashant Bhushan, learned counsel for the Respondent have been heard. 15. Placing reliance upon the judgment of this Court in Arvind Kejriwal v. Central Information Commission 2010 VI AD (Delhi) 669 it was submitted by Mr. Rao that the defence of privacy in a case like the present one cannot be lightly brushed aside and that in the present case the rights of the Ambassador against whom the complaint was made outweighed the public interest in ordering disclosure. 16. This Court is unable to accept the above submission. The judgment in Arvind Kejriwal was in the context of the information seeker wanting copy of the ACRs of Government officers from the level of Joint Secretary and above. The CIC in this context directed disclosure without even considering the applicability of Section 11 of the RTI Act. It was in the above context that this Court observed that where the information sought related to a third party the procedure under Section 11 (1) of the RTI Act could not be dispensed with. Consequently, the appeals filed by Mr. Kejriwal were restored to the file of the CIC for compliance with the procedure outlined under Section 11 (1) of the RTI Act. 17. In the present case, as has been noticed hereinbefore, on a request of the MEA to review its order on the basis of Section 11 (1) of the RTI Act, the matter was heard on 25th August 2009 and 28th August 2009 and notice was issued to the Ambassador for personal hearing on 28h August 2009. The Ambassador was heard by the CIC. It was after carrying out this exercise under Section 11 (1) of the RTI Act that the CIC came to the conclusion that the public interest in disclosure of the information sought outweighed any right to privacy claimed by the Ambassador. Therefore, the decision in Arvind Kejriwal is of no assistance to the Petitioner. 18. It was then submitted that once on perusal of the records, the CIC itself came to the conclusion that most of the allegations made in the complaint were5/22/2018 delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=172732&yr=2010 http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=172732&yr=2010 5/5 found to be baseless, there was no justification in directing disclosure of such report. 19. This Court would like to observe that where, upon enquiry, it has been found that the allegations made in the complaint were baseless and that the matter did not require to be enquired any further, such a report can hardly be said to be a document the disclosure of which would violate any privacy right of the person complained against. This Court concurs with the observations of the CIC that in the circumstances the information sought was not personal to the Ambassador. The complaint itself is about matters relating to her in an official capacity. The information on the expenditure of government money by a government official in an official capacity cannot be termed as ?personal information?. 20. This Court is satisfied that after a detailed examination of the report of the CVO and notings on the file, the CIC has come to the correct conclusion that the public interest in ordering disclosure outweighed any claim to the contrary with reference to Section 11 (1) read with Section 8 (1)(j) of the RTI Act. This Court notices that the CIC has also exercised a degree of caution in permitting the MEA to use Section 10 (1) of the RTI Act and if so required, severe those parts which might compromise the sources of the MEA. The procedure followed by the CIC with reference to Section 11 (1) of the RTI Act and its reasoning cannot be faulted. The apprehension expressed before the CIC about the possible misuse of the information by the Respondent was also expressed before this Court. No authority can proceed on the assumption that an information ordered to be disclosed will be misused. The mere expression of an apprehension of possible misuse of information cannot justify non-disclosure of information. 21. This Court finds no ground having made out for interference with the impugned order of the CIC. 22. The writ petition and the pending application are dismissed. S. MURALIDHAR, J SEPTEMBER 29, 2010 rk WP (Civil) No. 120/2010 Page 1 of 8 $ W.P.(C) 2794/2012 Page 1 of 8 * IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI % Judgment reserved on : 23.10.2013 Judgment pronounced on : 25.10.2013 + W.P.(C) 2794/2012 TELECOM REGULATOORY AUTHORITY OF INDIA …… Petitioner Through : Mr Saket Singh, Adv. versus YASH PAL ..... Respondent Through : Respondent in person. CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE V.K. JAIN V.K. JAIN, J. The respondent Yashpal applied to the CPIO of the petitioner - Telecom Regulatory Au thority of India (TRAI), seeking the following information: - “1. Certified copy of the call details of the following numbers. Call details should include incoming as well as outgoing details. Registration details of the following numbers (name, address, date of activation, etc). a) 9210023535 (From April 2006 - till date). b) 9716682799 (From April 2009 - till date). c) 011 -26215249 (From April 2005 - till date) 2. Certified copy of the SMS details (send and W.P.(C) 2794/2012 Page 2 of 8 received) of the following numbers: - a) 92100235 35 (From April 2006 - till date). b) 9716682799 (From April 2009 - till date).” The CPIO having refused to provided the information on the ground that he was seeking a third party information, the respondent preferred an appeal which came to be dismissed by the First Appellate Authority. Being aggrieved, the respondent preferred the Second Appeal before the Central information Commissioner (hereinafter referred to as „the Commission‟). Vide impugned order dated 29.12.2011, the Commission directed the petit ioner to write to the Service Provider concerned in exercise of its power under Section 12(1) of the TRAI Act, 1997, call for the requisite information subject to its availability with the Service Provider and pass on the same to the respondent. Being aggrieved from the aforesaid direction, the petitioner is before this Court by way of this writ petition. 2. Two issues primarily arise for consideration in this petition; the first being as to whether the information sought by the respondent, if available w ith the Service Provider can be accessed by the petitioner in exercise of the powers conferred upon it by Section 12(1) of TRAI Act W.P.(C) 2794/2012 Page 3 of 8 and secondly whether the information sought by the respondent is exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the Right t o Information Act. 3. Section 2(f) of the Right to Information Act defines „Information‟ to mean, inter alia, any information relating to any private body which can be accessed by Public Authority under any law for the time being in force. Section 12( 1) of the TRAI Act, 1997 empowers the said Authority, if considered expedient by it to do so, inter alia, to call upon any Service Provider to furnish in writing such information or explanation relating to its affairs as the Authority may require. The fun ctions of the Authority are prescribed in Section 11 of the aforesaid Act. I find merit in the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the power to call for information or explanation from the Service Provider can be exercised by the Aut hority only if such information or explanation is required for discharge of the functions assigned to it. The aforesaid power, in my view, cannot be exercised for the purposes which are alien to the functions of the Authority specified in Section 11 of the Act. Taking a contrary view will lead to the Authority assuming unbridle d power to call for information from a Service Provider irrespective of whether such information is necessary for an efficient discharge of the functions W.P.(C) 2794/2012 Page 4 of 8 assigned to the Authority or not. To provide information in respect of the subscribers of mobile telephones such as their names and addresses, their call details and copies of the SMSs sent by them certainly are not amongst the functions assigned to the Authority under Section 11 of the Act. The Authority was established primarily for the purpose of regulating the telecommunication services, adjudicating disputes, protecting the interests of service providers and consumers of telecom sectors and to promote and ensure orderly growth of the said sector. Providing information of the above -referred nature is not one of the purposes for which Authority was constituted. Moreover, the information under Section 12(1) can be sought only in relation to the affairs of the Service Provider an d not the affairs of a subscriber to telecom services. The call details of the subscriber and the SMSs sent by him is an information relating to the affairs of the subscriber and to the affairs of the Authority. If I take the view that an information of this nature can be requisitioned by TRAI, that would result in a situation where the Authority is able to violate with impunity the fundamental right of a citizen to his privacy by knowing with whom he has been communicating as well as the contents of the messages sent by him. W.P.(C) 2794/2012 Page 5 of 8 Therefore, in my view, the information which the respondent had sought from the CPIO of the petitioner cannot be accessed by the petitioner in exercise of the powers conferred upon it by Section 12(1) of the TRAI Act, 1997. 4. Even if I proceed on the assumption that the information which the respondent had sought from the petitioner can be obtained by TRAI from the Service Provider in exercise of the power conferred upon it by Section 12(1) of the Act, being personal information of the subscriber, who is a third party, and its disclosure having no relationship to any public activity or interest of the subscriber and also because its disclosure would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the subscriber, it is exempt from discl osure under Section 8(1)(j) of the Right to Information Act. 5. The question as to what constitutes „personal information ‟ under Section 8( 1) (j) and to what extent it is protected, if it relates to a third party came up for consideration before this Court in W.P.(C) No. 3444/2012 , Union of India vs. Hardev Singh decided on 23.8.2013 and the following view was taken: - “It would thus be seen that if the information sought by the applicant is a personal information relating to a third party, it cannot be disc losed, unless the information relates to any public activity W.P.(C) 2794/2012 Page 6 of 8 of a third party who has provided the said information or it is in public interest to disclose the information desired by the applicant. It further shows that a personal information cannot at all be disclosed if its disclosure would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the third party which has provided the said information, unless the larger public interest justifies such disclosure. In UPSC versus R.K. Jain [W.P(C) No.1243/2011] decide d on 13.7.2012 the following view was taken by this Court : “19. Therefore, “personal information” under the Act, would be information, as set forth above, that pertains to a person. As such it takes into its fold possibly every kind of information relati ng to the person. Now, such personal information of the person may, or may not, have relation to any public activity, or to public interest. At the same time, such personal information may, or may not, be private to the person. xxxx 24. “Public activity ‟ qua a person are those activities which are performed by the person in discharge of a public duty, i.e. in the public domain. There is an inherent public interest involved in the discharge of such activities, as all public duties are expected to be disch arged in public interest. Consequently, information of a person which is related to, or has a bearing on his public activities, is not exempt from disclosure under the scheme and provisions of the Act, whose primary object is to ensure an informed citizenr y and transparency of information and also to contain corruption. For example, take the case of a surgeon employed in a Government Hospital who performs surgeries on his patients who are coming to the government hospital. His personal information, relating to discharge of his public duty, i.e. his public activity, is not exempt from disclosure under the Act. 27.... whenever the querist applicant wishes to seek information, the disclosure of which can be made only W.P.(C) 2794/2012 Page 7 of 8 upon existence of certain special circumsta nces, for example - the existence of public interest, the querist should in the application (moved under Section 6 of the Act) disclose/ plead the special circumstance, so that the PIO concerned can apply his mind to it, and, in case he decides to issue not ice to the concerned third party under Section 11 of the Act, the third party is able to effectively deal with the same. Only then the PIO/appellate authority/CIC would be able to come to an informed decision whether, or not, the special circumstances exis t in a given case. 28. I may also observe that public interest does not mean that which is interesting as gratifying curiosity or love of information or amusement; but that in which a class of the community have a pecuniary interest, or some interest by which their rights or liabilities are affected... xxx 34. It follows that the „privacy‟ of a person, or in other words his “private information‟, encompasses the personal intimacies of the home, the family, marriage, motherhood, procreation, child rearing and of the like nature. “Personal information”, on the other hand, as aforesaid, would be information, in any form, that pertains to an individual. Therefore, „private information‟ is a part of “personal information‟. All that is private is personal, but all that is personal may not be private. ” 6. With whom a subscriber communicates and what messages he sends or receives are the personal affairs of a subscriber, disclosure of which is bound to impinge on his privacy. The information sought by the respon dent, therefore, was personal information of a third party, exempt from disclosure under Section 8 (1) ( j) of the RTI Act. 7. During the course of hearing the respondent, who appeared in person, expressed a grievance that he is being harassed by his daught er- in-law and the information sought by him was require d in connection W.P.(C) 2794/2012 Page 8 of 8 with various cases instituted by her against him. If that be so, the appropriate remedy available to the respondent would be either to approach the concerned investigating agency, which is looking into the complaint made against him or to apply to the concerned Court at an appropriate stage, for summoning the record of the Service Provider. The respondent expressed an apprehension that by the time his matter reaches the Court, the information required by him may no more be available with th e Service Provider since such information is preserved for a limited period. If that be so, the respondent can avail such remedy as is open to him in law for a suitable direction to the Service Provider in this regard, but, seeking such an information und er the provisions of Right to Information Act is certainly not an appropriate relief. 8. For the reasons stated hereinabove, the impugned order dated 29.12.2011 passed by the Commission cannot be sustained and the same is hereby set aside. The writ petit ion stands disposed of. No order as to costs. V.K.JAIN, J OCTOBER 25, 2013 bg W.P.(C) 903/2013 Page 1 of 10 30 $~ * IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI + W.P.(C) 903/2013 THDC INDIA LTD ..... Petitioner Through : Mr. Neeraj Malhotra with Mr. Prithu Garg, Advs. versus R.K.RATURI ..... Respondent Through : Mr. R.K. Saini, Adv. % Date of Decision : 08th July, 2014 CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MANMOHAN J U D G M E N T MANMOHAN , J: (Oral) 1. The present writ petition has been filed challenging the order dated 04th January, 2013 passed by the Central Information Commission ( for short „CIC‟) whereby the petitioner has been directed to provide photocopies of the DPC proceedings including the comparative grading statement pertaining to the recommended candidates as well as ACRs of the appellant himself for the p eriod mentioned by him in his RTI application. 2. The rele vant portion of the impugned order is reproduced hereinbelow: - ―4. We have carefully considered the contents of the RTI application and the response of the CPIO. The objective of the Right to Information (RTI) Act is to bring about W.P.(C) 903/2013 Page 2 of 10 transparency in the func tioning of the public authorities. All decision making in the government and all its undertakings must be objective and transparent. It is only by placing the details of all decision making in the public domain that such objectivity and transparency can be ensured. Therefore, we do not see any reason why the DPC proceedings, specially, the comparative gradings of those recommended for promotion should not be disclosed. It is not at all correct to claim that such information is held in a fiduciary capacity. After all, the DPC operates as a part of the administrative decision making process in any organisation. The material that it considers is also generated within the organisation. Therefore, it is not correct to say that the DPC proceedings including the re commendations made by it can be said to be held by the public authority in a fiduciary capacity. About the ACRs of the Appellant, the Supreme Court of India has already held that the civilian employees must be allowed access to their confidential rolls, sp ecially when these are held out against them in the matter of their career promotion. Following the Supreme Court order, the Department of Personnel and Training, we understand, has already issued a circular for disclosure of ACR. ‖ 3. Mr. Neeraj Malhotra, le arned counsel for the petitioner submits that the impact of the impugned order passed by CIC is that the petitioner would be required to give information pertaining to DPC proceedings including the comparative grading statement pertaining to the recommende d candidates, which information is excluded under the provisions of Section s 8(1)(e) and 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act. He emphasizes that the information directed to be released pertaining to other employees of the petitioner is being held by the petitioner in fiduciary capacity and would amount to disclosure of personal information. W.P.(C) 903/2013 Page 3 of 10 4. Sections 8(1)(e) and 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act are reproduced hereinbelow: - “8. Exemption from disclosure of information. —(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen, — xxx xxx xxx (e) information available to a person in his fiduciary relationship, unless the competent authority is satisfied that the larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information; xxx xxx xxx (j) information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Inform ation Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information: Provided that the information which cannot be denied to the P arliament or a State Legislature shall not be denied to any person. ‖ 5. Mr. Malhotra also submits that as some of the information sought for pertain s to third party, provisions of Section s 11(1) and 19(4) of the RTI Act would be applicable. Sections 11 (1) and 19(4) of the RTI Act are reproduced hereinbelow: - ―11. Third party information. —(1) Where a Central Public Information Officer or a State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, intends to disclose any W.P.(C) 903/2013 Page 4 of 10 information or record, or part thereof on a request made under this Act, which relates to or has been supplied by a third party and has been treated as confidential by that third party, the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, shall, within five days from the receipt of the request, give a written notice to such third party of the request and of the fact that the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, intends to disclose the information or reco rd, or part thereof, and invite the third party to make a submission in writing or orally, regarding whether the information should be disclosed, and such submission of the third party shall be kept in view while taking a decision about disclosure of infor mation: Provided that except in the case of trade or commercial secrets protected by law, disclosure may be allowed if the public interest in disclosure outweighs in importance any possible harm or injury to the interests of such third party. xxx xxx xxx 19. Appeal. - xxx xxx xxx (4) If the decision of the Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be, against which an appeal is preferred relates to information of a third party, the Central Information Commission or State Information Commission, as the case may be, shall give a reasonable opportunity of being heard to that third party. ‖ 6. On the other hand, Mr. Saini, learned counsel for the responden t submits that it is difficult to comprehend that any public interest would be served by denying information to the respondent with regard to DPC proceedings including the comparative grading statements pertaining to the W.P.(C) 903/2013 Page 5 of 10 recommended candidates as also phot ocopy of respondent‟s ACR containing the remarks of the reporting and the reviewing officers as well as accepting authority. 7. Mr. Saini points out that the respondent himself is a Government servant working in the same corporation and was considered by th e selection committee for promotion in the said DPC proceedings. Hence, according to him, the respondent has a right to seek information regarding DPC proceedings including the comparative grading statements pertaining to the recommended candidates. 8. In support of his submission, Mr. Saini relie s upon a judgment of the Supreme Court in Dev Dutt v. Union of India and Others (2008) 8 SCC 725 wherein it has been held as under: - ―36. In the present case, we are developing the principles of natural justice by holding that fairness and transparency in public administration requires that all entries (whether poor, fair, average, good or very good) in the Annual Confidential Report of a public servant, whether in civil, judicial, police or any other State service (except the military), must be communicated to him within a reasonable period so that he can make a representation for its upgradation. This in our opinion is the correct legal position even though there may be no Rule/G.O. requiring communication of the e ntry, or even if there is a Rule/G.O. prohibiting it, because the principle of non - arbitrariness in State action as envisaged by Article 14 of the Constitution in our opinion requires such communication. Article 14 will override all rules or government ord ers.‖ 9. Mr. Saini lastly submits that there is no question of compliance of pre-condition and pre -requisite of Section 11 (1) read with Section 19(4) of W.P.(C) 903/2013 Page 6 of 10 the RTI Act. 10. Having heard learned counsel for the parties, this Court finds that i n the case of Arvind Ke jriwal v. Central Public Information Officer AIR 2010 Delhi 216 , a Coordinate Bench of this Court has held that service record of a Government employee contained in the DPC minutes/ACR is “personal” to such officer and that such information can be provided to a third party only after giving a finding as regards the larger pubic interest involved. It was also held in the said judgement that thereafter third party procedure mentioned in Section 11 (1) of the RTI Act would have to be followed. The relevant por tion of the judgment in Arvind Kejriwal is reproduced hereinbelow: - ―21. This Court has considered the above submissions. It requires to be noticed that under the RTI Act information that is totally exempt from disclosure has been listed out in Section 8. The concept of privacy is incorporated in Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act. This provision would be a defense available to a person about whom information is being sought. Such defence could be taken by a third party in a proceeding under Section 11(1) when upon being issued notice such third party might want to resist disclosure on the grounds of privacy. This is a valuable right of a third party that encapsulates the principle of natural justice inasmuch as the statute mandates that there cannot be a disclo sure of information pertaining to or which „relates to‟ such third party without affording such third party an opportunity of being heard on whether such disclosure should be ordered. This is a procedural safeguard that has been inserted in the RTI Act to balance the rights o f privacy and the public interest involved in disclosure of such information. Whether one should trump the other is ultimately for the information officer to decide in the facts of a given case. W.P.(C) 903/2013 Page 7 of 10 xxx xxx xxx 25. The logic of the Section 11(1) RTI Act is plain. Once the information seeker is provided information relating to a third party, it is no longer in the private domain. Such information seeker can then disclose in turn such information to the whole world. There may be an officer who may not want th e whole world to know why he or she was overlooked for promotion. The defence of privacy in such a case cannot be lightly brushed aside saying that since the officer is a public servant he or she cannot possibly fight shy of such disclosure. There may be y et another situation where the officer may have no qualms about such disclosure. And there may be a third category where the credentials of the officer appointed may be thought of as being in public interest to be disclosed. The importance of the post held may also be a factor that might weigh with the information officer. This exercise of weighing the competing interests can possibly be undertaken only after hearing all interested parties. Therefore the procedure under Section 11(1) RTI Act.‖ 11. This Court i s also of the opinion that the finding of public interest warranting disclosure of the said information under Sections 8(1)(e) and 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act and the procedure contemplated under Section s 11(1) and 19(4) of the RTI Act a re mandatory in nature and cannot be waived. In the present case, CIC has directed the petitioner to provide DPC minutes to the respondent without considering the defence of the petitioner under Section 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act and without following the procedure specified under Section s 11(1) and 19(4) of the RTI Act. It is pertinent to mention that Sections 11(1) and 19(4) of the RTI Act incorporate the principles of natural justice. Further , in the present case no finding has been given by CIC as to whether public interest wa rrant ed such a disclosure. W.P.(C) 903/2013 Page 8 of 10 12. However, this Court is of the view that the respondent is entitled to the contents of his own ACR after redaction of the names of the reviewing, reporting and accepting officers. In fact, a nother coordinate Bench of this Court in THDC India Ltd. v. T. Chandra Biswas 199(2013) DLT 284 has held as under: - ―9. While the learned counsel for the respondent has contended before me that the respondent ought to have been supplied with the ACRs for the period 2004 to 2007, the responden t has not assailed that part of the order of the CIC. In my view, while the contention of the respondent has merit, which is that she cannot be denied information with regard to her own ACRs and that information cannot fall in the realm of any of the exclu sionary provisions cited before me by the learned counsel for the petitioner i.e. Section 8(1)(d), (e) and (j), there is a procedural impediment, in as much as, there is no petition filed to assail that part of the order passed by the CIC. 9.1. In my vie w, the right to obtain her own ACRs inheres in the respondent which cannot be denied to the respondent under the provisions of Section 8(1)(d), (e) and (j) of the RTI Act. The ACRs are meant to inform an employee as to the manner in which he has performed in the given period and the areas which require his attention, so that he may improve his performance qua his work. 9.2 That every entry in the ACR of an employee requires to be disclosed whether or not an executive instruction is issued in that behalf – is based on the premise that disclosure of the contents of ACR results in fairness in action and transparency in public administration. See Dev Dutt vs Union of India (2008) 8 SCC 725 at page 732, paragraph 13; page 733, paragraph 17; and at page 737, paragraphs 36, 37 and 38. W.P.(C) 903/2013 Page 9 of 10 9.3 Mr Malhotra sought to argue that, in Dev Dutt’s case, the emphasis was in providing information with regard to gradings and not the narrative. Thus a submission cannot be accepted for more than one reason. 9.4 First, providin g to an employee gradings without the narrative is like giving a conclusion in judicial/quasi - judicial or even an administrative order without providing the reasons which led to the conclusion. If the purpose of providing ACRs is to enable the employee to assess his performance and to judge for himself whether the person writing his ACR has made an objective assessment of his work, the access to the narrative which led to the grading is a must. [See State of U.P. Vs. Yamuna Shankar Misra and Anr., (1997) 4 SCC 7]. The narrative would fashion the decision of the employee as to whether he ought to challenge the grading set out in the ACR. 9.5 Second, the fact that provision of ACRs is a necessary concomitant of a transparent, fair and efficient administratio n is now recognized by the DOPT in its OM dated 14.05.2009. The fact that the OM is prospective would not, in my view, impinge upon the underlying principle the OM seeks to establish. The only caveat one would have to enter, is that, while providing the co ntents of the ACR the names of the Reviewing, Reporting and the Accepting Officer will have to be redacted. ‖ 13. Consequently, this Court is of the view that ACR grading/ratings as also the marks given to the candidates based on the said ACR grading/ratings a nd their interview marks contained in the DPC proceedings can be disclosed only to the concerned employee and not to any other employee as that would constitute third party information. This Court is also of the opinion that third party information can on ly be disclosed if a W.P.(C) 903/2013 Page 10 of 10 finding of a larger public interest being involved is given by CIC and further if third party procedure as prescribed under Sections 11 (1) and 19(4) of the RTI Act is followed. 14. Accordingly, the present writ petition is allowed and th e matter is remanded back to CIC for consideration of petitioner‟s defences under Section s 8(1)(e) and Section 8(1)( j) of the RTI Act and if the CIC is of the view that larger public interest is involved, it shall thereafter follow the third party procedure as prescribed under Sections 11(1) and 19(4) of the RTI Act. 15. With the aforesaid observations and directions, the present writ petition is disposed of.

Petitioner versus STATE BANK OF BIKANER & JAIPUR ..... Respondent Advocates who appeared in this case: For the Petitioner : Mr Rajesh Yadav and Mr Ruchira. For the Respondent : Mr Rajiv Aggarwal and Mr S. Sethi. CORAM: - HON’BLE MR JUSTICE VIBHU BAKHRU JUDGMENT VIBHU BAKHRU, J (ORAL) CM No.10876/2014 Allowed, subject to all just exceptions. The application stands disposed of. W.P.(C) 5478/2014 1. The present petition has been filed by the petitioner impugning an order dated 13.06.2014 passed by the Central Information Commissioner (hereinafter referred t o as ‘ CIC’), whereby the appeal preferred by the petitioner against an order dated 03.04.2013 passed by the First Appellate Authority had been rejected. The order dated 03.04.2013 had in turn rejected the petitioner’s appeal against an order dated 11.02.20 13 passed by respondent bank’s Central Public Information Officer (hereinafter referred as ‘CPIO ’). By the said order , the CPIO of respondent bank refused to W.P.(C) No. 5478/2014 Page 2 of 5 provide the information sought by the petitioner in respect of its customer inter alia on the ground that the same was held by the bank in a fiduciary capacity and was exempted under Section 8 of the Right to Information Act, 2005 ( hereinafter referred to as the 'RTI Act '). 2. Briefly stated, the facts are that on 18.01.2013, the petitioner applied under the RTI Act to the CPIO of the respondent bank seeking the following information with respect to Manraj Charitable Trust - a society registered under the Societies Registration Act , 1860 :- “a) Entire record pertaining to opening of the Bank Account by MCT including the a/c opening form. b) All subsequent documents, resolutions, authority letters, submitted with the Bank. c) The actual date of submission/receipt of letter dated 14/8/99 in and by the bank.” 3. Thereafter , the petitioner sent another application on 22.01.2013 seeking further information. By its order dated 11.02.2013, th e CPIO of the respondent bank declined to provide the said information on the ground that information pertaining to its customers was exempt from the provisions of the RTI Act by virtue of clauses (d), (e) and (j) of Section 8(1) of the RTI Act. Aggrieved by the denial of the said information, the petitioner preferred an appeal before the First Appellate Authority , whi ch was also dismissed by an order dated 03.04.2013. The decision of the First Appellate Authority was carried in appeal before the CIC. 4. By the impugned order, the CIC accepted the submissions of the respondent bank that the information in respect of its c ustomers was W.P.(C) No. 5478/2014 Page 3 of 5 exempt form the RTI Act as the same was held by the bank in a fiduciary capacity and, accordingly, rejected the appeal of the petitioner . 5. The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the petitioner was the secretary of Manraj Charitable Trust and as an office bearer was entitled to information relating to the said Trust. It was further submitted that Manraj Charitable Trust was a charitable institution and, therefore, larger public interest would warrant disclosure of informat ion by the respondent bank. The learned counsel for the petitioner relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in Bihar Public Service Commission v. Saiyed Hussain Abbas Rizwi : (2012) 13 SCC 61 to contend that even information held in fiduciary capacity c an be disclosed by a Competent Authority if a larger public interest so warrants. 6. The respondent bank claimed that as per its records, the petitioner was neither reflected as a Secretary of the Trust nor was authoris ed to operate the bank accounts. It was further stated that there were disputes pending between the petitioner and her relatives. And, the information sought by the petitioner was not for any larger public interest but, apparently, to assist her in the litigation pending between the petitioner and her family members. 7. The controversy raised in the present petition is whether a bank is obliged to disclose information pertaining to its customers in response to an application made under the RTI Act . 8. The Bank, while dealing with its customers, acts in various capacities. Undisputedly, the relationship between a customer and a banker requires trust, good faith, honesty and confidence. Black’s law dictionary W.P.(C) No. 5478/2014 Page 4 of 5 defines fiduciary relationship as “one founded on trust or confidence reposed by one perso n in the integrity and fidelity of another.” Fiduciary relationship in law is ordinarily a confidential relationship; one which is founded on the trust and confidence . In this view, a banker would undoubtedly, stand in a fiduciary capacity in respect of transactions and information provided by its customers. 9. The Supreme Court in Bihar Public Service Commission v. Saiyed Hussain Abbas Rizwi : (2012) 13 SCC 61 examined the term “fiduciary relationship” in context of Section 8 of the RTI Act and held as under:- “The term “fiduciary relationship” is used to describe a situation or transaction where one person places complete confidence in another person in regard to his affairs, business or transactions. This aspect has been discussed in some detail in the judgment of this Court in the case of Central Board of Secondary Education. Section 8(1)(e), therefore, carves out a protection in favour of a person who possesses information in his fiduciary relationship. This protection can be negated by the competent a uthority where larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information, in which case, the authority is expected to record reasons for its satisfaction. Another very significant provision of the Act is 8(1)(j). In terms of this provision, inform ation which relates to personal information, the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual would fall within the exempted category, unless the autho rity concerned is satisfied that larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information. It is, therefore, to be understood clearly that it is a statutory exemption which must operate as a rule and only in exceptional cases would disclosure be permitted, that too, for reasons to be recorded demonstrating satisfaction to the test of larger public interest.” W.P.(C) No. 5478/2014 Page 5 of 5 10. The records of the bank do not indicate the petitioner to be a secretary of the said Trust or its authorized officer. Thus, the bank has treated the petitioner as a stranger, and in my view, rightly so. The respondent bank is thus not obliged to provide any information to the petitioner in respect of the account of the said trust. 11. Admittedly, the petitioner has certain pending disputes with re gard to the affairs of Manraj Charitable Trust and a suit (being CS(OS) No.3203/2012) is stated to have been filed by the petitioner in this Court in her capacity as Secretary of the Trust in question. In this view, the submission of the petitioner that th e respondent bank is liable to disclose the information sought in larger public interest, also cannot be accepted. 12. The present petition is , accordingly, without merit and is dismissed.

CORAM: HON'BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE HON'BLE M S. JUSTICE DEEPA SHARMA Ms.G.ROHINI, CJ 1. This appeal is preferred against the order dated 19.12.2014 where under the learned Single Judge allowed W.P.(C) No.1842/2012 filed by the respondent herein and set aside the order dated 01.02.2012 passed by the Central Information Commissioner (CIC) under the Right to Information Act, 2005 (for short ‘RTI Act’). 2. The facts in brief are as under: - 3. The appellant herein filed an application under the RTI Act with the Ce ntral Public Information Officer, Department of Justice, Government of India seeking the information relating to the details of the LPA No.34/2015 Page 2 of 6 medical facilities availed by the individual judges and their family members of the Supreme Court in last three years includ ing the information relating to expenses on private treatment in India or abroad. The CPIO, to whom the said application was transferred under Section 6(3) of the Act rejected the same by order dated 02.02.2011 on the ground that it is an exempted informa tion under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act. The appeal preferred by the appellant herein was dismissed by the First Appellate Authority by order dated 07.03.2011. However, the further appeal to the CIC was allowed and by order dated 03.08.2011, the CIC direct ed the CPIO to provide the total amount of medical expenses of individual judges reimbursed by the Supreme Court during the last three years both in India and abroad wherever applicable. There was also a direction that the CPIO shall bring to the notice o f the competent authority in the Supreme Court and ensure that arrangements are made in future for maintaining the information as expected in Section 4(1)( a) of the RTI Act. In pursuance thereof, b y letter dated 30.08.2011, the CPIO while furnishing the a ctual total expenditure for the years 2007 -08, 2008 - 09 and 2009 -10, informed the appellant herein that the judge -wise information regarding actual total medical expenditure is not required to be maintained and is not maintained . Contending that the inform ation furnished by CPIO is not in compliance with the order dated 03.08.2011, the appellant herein had again approached the CIC and thereupon by order dated 01.02.2012 the C IC reiterated its directions dated 03.08.2011 . 4. Aggrieved by the said order, the appellant herein filed W.P.(C) No.1842/2012 . By the order under appeal, the learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition holding that the order passed by CIC LPA No.34/2015 Page 3 of 6 purportedly in exercise of power under Section 19(8)(a)(iv) of the Act is erroneous. While tak ing note of the fact that the information sought by the respondent/appellant herein was with regard to expenses incurred on medical facilities of judges retired as well as serving and that the said information is personal information which is exempt ed from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act and that the medical bills would indicate the treatment and/or medicines required by individuals and the same would clearly be an invasion of the privacy, the learned Single Judge held that the question of i ssuing any directions under Section 19(8)(a)(iv) of the Act to facilitate access to such information does not arise. 5. Assailing the said order, Sh.Prashant Bhushan the learned Counsel appearing for the appellant vehemently contended that the information pertaining to expenditure of public money on a public servant is not exempted under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act. It is submitted by the learned counsel that only the information which relates to personal information which has no relation to any public a ctivity or interest or which would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of the individual is exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) and that the same is not attracted to the case on hand since the medical bills of the judges are reimbursed from the public money. Placing reliance upon the decisions in State o f UP Vs. Raj Narain, AIR 1975 SC 865 , S.P.Gupta Vs. President of India & Ors., AIR 1982 SC 149 and Union of India Vs. Association for Democratic Reforms, AIR 2002 SC 2112 it is further contended by the learned counsel that the object and purpose of the RTI Act being promoting transparency and accountability in spending the LPA No.34/2015 Page 4 of 6 public money to strengthen the core constitutional values of a democratic republic, the information sought by the appellant re lating to reimbursement of medical bills of the individual judges, under no circumstances, can be termed as exempted information under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act. 6. On the other hand, it is submitted by Sh.Siddharth Luthra, the learned Senior Advocate appe aring for the respondent s No.1 & 2 that the information sought by the appellant would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of the individual judges and, therefore, the learned Single Jude has rightly held that Section 8(1)(j) is attracted. To substantiat e his submission, the learned Senior Counsel relied upon Central Board of Secondary Education & Anr. Vs. Aditya Bandopadhyay & Ors. 2011 (8) SCC 497 and Girish Ramchandra Deshpande Vs. Central Information Commissioner & Ors . (2013) 1 SCC 212 . 7. We have giv en our thoughtful consideration to the rival submissions made by the parties. It is no doubt true that the RTI Act, 2005 is aimed at providing access to the citizens to information under the control of public authorities in order to promote transparency a nd accountability in the working of the every public authority. However, as held in the case of Aditya Bandopadhyay & Ors. (Supra) the RTI Act contains certain safeguards by providing exemption from disclosure of certain information including the informat ion which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual except where the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information. 8. In the case on hand, the CPIO by his letter dated 30.08.2011 has admittedly furnished the amou nt that has been reimbursed on medical LPA No.34/2015 Page 5 of 6 treatment from the budget grant of each year for the period from 2007 to 2010 making it clear that during the said period no reimbursement for medical treatment abroad was made. It was also specifically mentioned by the CPIO that the judge -wise information was not maintained as the same was not required to be maintained . 9. It is no doubt true that Section 19(8)(a)(iv) empowers the appellate authority to require the public authority to make necessary changes to its practices in relation to the maintenance, management and destruction of record for the purpose of securing compliance with the provisions of the RTI Act. However, as rightly held by the learned Single Judge the said power cannot be invoked to direct creation of information but the same can be only with regard to the existing information. 10. The information sought by the appellant includes the details of the medical facilities availed by the individual judges . The same being personal information , we are of the view that providing such information would undoubtedly amount to invasion of the privacy. We have also taken note of the fact that it was conceded before the learned Single Judge by the learned counsel for the appellant herein that no larger public intere st is involved in seeking the details of the medical facilities availed by the individual judges . It may also be mentioned that the total expenditure incurred for the medical treatment of the judges for the period in question was already furnished by the CPIO by his letter dated 30.08.2011 and it is not the case of the appellant that the said expenditure is excessive or exorbitant. That being so, we are unable to understand how the public interest requires disclosure of the details of the medical faciliti es availed by the individual judges . In the absence of any such LPA No.34/2015 Page 6 of 6 larger public interest, no direction whatsoever can be issued under Section 19(8)(a)(iv) of the Act by the appellate authorities. Therefore on that ground also the order passed by the CIC da ted 01.02.2012 is unsustainable and the same has rightly been set aside by the learned Single Judge. 11. For the aforesaid reasons, the appeal is devoid of any merits and the same is accordingly dismissed. No order as to costs.

Petitioner Through : Mr. Naresh Kaushik, Adv. With Mr.Vardhman Kaushik, Adv. versus HAWA SINGH ..... Respondent Through : None. CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE VIBHU BAKHRU O R D E R 21.11.2014 1. The petitioner impugns an order dated 18.06.2013 passed by the Central Information Commission (hereinafter referred to as ?CIC?) whereby the petitioner was directed to disclose certain information relating to other candidates who were subject to the selection process undertaken by the petitioner. 2. The question to be adressed is whether the petitioner was obliged to disclose information relating to other candidates i.e. the third party information under the Right to Information Act, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as the ?Act?). 3. The brief facts of the present case are that the respondent was working as a Senior Administrative Officer (Legal) in the office of Controller and Auditor General of India (hereafter ?CAG?) and had appeared before the Departmental Promotion Committee (hereinafter ?DPC?) for the selection to the post of Deputy Director (Legal) in the office of CAG. The respondent had filed an application dated 05.11.2012 under the Act inter alia seeking certain information relating to the said selection process which included the Bio Data as well as other information relating to other candidates. 4. While most of the information was supplied by the petitioner, the 5/22/2018 delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=237674&yr=2014 http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=237674&yr=2014 2/3 information relating to other candidates and certain other information was declined by the petitoner. This led the respondent to file an appeal before the first appellate authority, which was rejected by an order dated 07.01.2013. Aggrieved by the same, the respondent preferred an appeal before CIC. The CIC considered the appeal and directed the petitioner to supply the following information:- ?i. The biodata of the candidates recommended by the Selection Committee for deputation; ii. the marks awarded to both the selected candidates as well as to the Appellant during the selection process; iii the copy of the pro forma and comparative statement of eligibility placed before the Selection Committee, if any: iv. a statement showing the period for which the ACRs/APARs of various candidates had been considered by the Selection Committee including the grading of the selected candidates as well as that of the Appellant and v. The copy of the reserve list prepared by the Selection Committee provided the selected candidate has already joined her duty.? 5. Aggrieved by the direction of CIC to provide the Bio Data of the candidates recommended by the Selection Committee for deputation, the petitioner has preferred this petition. 6. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the information sought by the respondent is a third party information and thus cannot be disclosed except in public interest and after following the due procedure under Section 11 and Section 19(4) of the Right to Information Act, 2005. The learned counsel referred to a decision of the Supreme Court in Union Public Service Commission v. Gouhari Kamila: Civil Appeal No. 6362/2013, decided on 06.08.2013 whereby the Supreme Court following its earlier decision rendered in CBSE v. Aditya Bandopadhyay: (2011) 8 SCC 497 held as under:- ?12. By applying the ratio of the aforesaid judgment, we hold that the CIC committed a serious illegality by directing the Commission to disclose the information sought by the Respondent, at point Nos. 4 and 5 and the High Court committed an error by approving his order. 13. We may add that neither the CIC nor the High Court came to the conclusion that disclosure of the information relating to other candidates was necessary in larger public interest. Therefore, the present case is not covered by the exception carved out in Section?8(1)(e)?of the Act.? 7. In view of the above, the submission of the learned counsel for the5/22/2018 delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=237674&yr=2014 http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/dhcqrydisp_o.asp?pn=237674&yr=2014 3/3 petitioner that the present case is covered by the decision of the Supreme Court in Gouhari Kamila (supra) is well founded. Clearly, the Bio Data of the other selected candidates is a third party information and is exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)(e) and under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act. 8. The impugned order does not indicate that disclosure of this information was vital in larger public interest. Further, it does not appear that the CIC had issued any notice under Section 19(4) of the RTI Act to other candidates before directing the disclosure of the information. 9. Accordingly, the petition is allowed and the impugned order, in so far as it relates to disclosure of ?Bio Data of candidates recommended by the Selection Committee for deputation? is concerned, is set aside. No order as to costs.

(Oral) Vide application dated 12.09.2008, the respondent sought the following information from the CPIO of the petitioner -UPSC: - “a) Subject matter of information: - Selection list of eleven number of Dy Director of Mines Safety (Mining) by UPSC in pursuance of ref no of F.I./287/2006/R -VI contained in advertisement no 8/03 (Employment News 28 April -4May 2007) (b) The period to which the information relates: - Year 2008 -09 W.P.(C) No. 5812/2010 Page 2 of 7 (c) Specific details of information required: - Please provide the seniority cum merit list of selected eleven number of Dy Director of Mines Safety (Mining) by UPSE in pursuance of ref no of F.I./287/2006/R -VI contained in advertisement no 08/03 (Employment News 28 April -4 May 2007) for appointment in Director General of Mines Safety, Dhanbad under Ministry of Labour and Employment, New Delhi. The list should contain the details of date of birth, institution & year of passing their graduation, field experience of company and marks obtained in interview and caste of the candidate. 2. The information (a) and (b) above has already been provided to the respondent. As regards information at (c) above, the petitioner has already provided the list of the recommended c andidates along with their inter se seniority -cum-merit and the same is available at page 43 of the paper book. The petitioner, however, has declined to provide information such as date of birth, institution and year of passing graduation, field experienc e, marks obtained in interview and the caste of the selected candidates. 3. The Central Information Commission vide impugned order dated 07.06.2010, while dealing with the plea of the petitioner that being personal information of the selected candidates, the aforesaid W.P.(C) No. 5812/2010 Page 3 of 7 information is exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the Right to Information Act, inter alia , held as under: - “In this case although the information can arguably be treated as personal information, under no circumstances can infor mation given for participation in a public activity like a public examination be deemed to have no relationship to such public activity. Shri Kamal Bhagat, Jt. Secretary, has argued that it is not the practice in the UPSC to disclose interview results for those candidates as are not selected. In this case, however, appellant Ms. Pinki Ganeriwal ha s asked for information only regarding „selected‟ candidates. This information which was not received by the appellant on the ground taken by the CPIO, UPSC, will now be provided to appellant Ms. Pinki Ganeriwal within 10 working days from the date of receipt of this decision notice. The appeal is thus allowed. There will be no costs, since appellant has not been compelled to travel to be heard, and the responses o f CPIO, although held to be inadequate, were made according to the time mandated and as per CPIO‟s genuine understanding of the law, and therefore not liable to penalty .” 4. A similar issue came up for consideration before this Court in W.P.(C) No. 6508/2 010 titled UPSC vs. Mator Singh , where the W.P.(C) No. 5812/2010 Page 4 of 7 respondent before this Court had inter alia sought information such as particulars (name, qualification and experience) of eligible applicants for appointment to 7 post of Principal (female) reserved for Scheduled Castes in response to UPSE special advertisement No. 52/2006. The CPIO declined to provide the aforesaid information and the first appeal filed by the respondent was also dismissed. In a second appeal filed by the respondent, the Central Information Comm ission directed disclosure of the aforesaid information. Setting aside the order passed by the Commission, this Court, inter alia , held as under: - “5.

In the aforesaid case, the respondent before the Apex Court had sought inter alia the following information: “4. How many years of experience in the relevant field (Analytical methods and research in the field of Ballistics) mentioned in the advertisement have been considered for the short listing of the candidates for the interview held for the date on 16.3.2010? 5. Kindly provide the certified xerox copies of experience certificates of all the candidates called for the interview on 16.3.2010 who have W.P.(C) No. 5812/2010 Page 5 of 7 claimed the experience in the relevant field as per records available in the UPSC and as mentioned by the candidates at Sl.No. 10(B) of Part-I of their application who are called for the interview held on 16.3.20 10.” The Central Information Commission directed the petitioner -UPSC to supply the aforesaid information. Being aggrieved from the direction given by the Commission, the petitioner filed WP (C) No.3365/2011 which came to be dismissed by a learned Single Judge of this Court. The appeal filed by the UPSC also came to be dismissed by a Division Bench of this Court. Being still aggrieved, the petitioner filed the aforesaid appeal by way of Special Leave. Allowing the appeal filed by the UPSC, the Apex Court inter alia held as under, relying upon its earlier decision in Bihar School Examination Board Vs. Suresh Prasad Sinha (2009) 8 SCC 483: “One of the duties of the fiduciary is to make thorough disclosure of all the relevant facts of all transactions betwee n them to the beneficiary, in a fiduciary relationship. By that logic, the examining body, if it is in a fiduciary relationship with an examinee, will be liable to make a full disclosure of the evaluated answer books to the examinee and at the same time, owe a duty to the examinee not to disclose the answer books to anyone else. If A entrusts a document or an article to B to be processed, on completion of processing, B is not expected to give the document or article to anyone else but is bound to give the s ame to A who entrusted W.P.(C) No. 5812/2010 Page 6 of 7 the document or article to B for processing. Therefore, if a relationship of fiduciary and beneficiary is assumed between the examining body and the examinee with reference to the answer book, Section 8(1)(e)would operate as an exemp tion to prevent access to any third party and will not operate as a bar for the very person who wrote the answer book, seeking inspection or disclosure of it. ” The Apex Court held that the Commission committed a serious illegality by directing the UPSC to disclose the information at points 4 & 5 and the High Court also committed an error by approving the said order. It was noted that neither the CIC nor the High Court recorded a finding that disclosure of the aforesaid information relating to other candid ates was necessary to larger public interest and, therefore, the case was not covered by the exception carved out in Section 8 (1) (e) of the RTI Act. 6. In the case before this Court no finding has been recorded by the Commission that it was in the larger public interest to disclose the information with respect to the qualification and experience of other shortlisted candidates. In the absence of recording such a finding the Commission could not have directed disclosure of the aforesaid information to the respondent.” 5. In the present case, the information such as date of birth, institution and year of passing graduation, field experience and caste is W.P.(C) No. 5812/2010 Page 7 of 7 personal information of the selected candidates. There is no finding by the Commission that it was in lar ger public interest to disclose the aforesaid personal information of the recommended candidates. Even in his application seeking information, the respondent did not claim that any larger public interest was involved in disclosing the aforesaid information . In the absence of such a claim in the application and a finding to this effect by the Commission, no direction for disclosure of the aforesaid personal information could have been given. 6. For the reasons stated hereinabove, the impugned order dated 07.06.2010 passed by the Central Information Commission is hereby set aside. The writ petition stands disposed of. No order as to costs.

JAIN, J NOVEMBER 08, 2013 BG W.P.(C) 13219/2009 Page 1 of 8 IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI % Judgment delivered on: 24.08 .2017 + W.P.(C) 13219/2009 & CM 14393/2009 MUNICIPAL CORPORATION DELHI ..... Petitioner Versus RAJBIR ..... Respondent \ Advocates who appeared in th is case: For the Petitioner : Ms Biji Rajesh and Ms Eshita Baruah, Advocate for Gaurang Kanth. For the Respondent : Mr V.K. Sharma . CORAM HON’BLE MR JUSTICE VIBHU BAKHRU JUDGMENT VIBHU BAKHRU, J 1. The petitioner (hereafter ‗MCD‘) has filed the present petition, inter alia, impugning an order dated 06.10.2009 (hereafter ‗the impugned order‘) passed by the Central Information Commission (hereafter ‗the CIC‘ ). By the impugned order, the CIC has allowed respondent‘ s appeal and ha s directed MCD to disclose the information sought by him. The MCD claims that the information which it is called upon to disclose is exempt from such disclosure under Section 8( 1)(j) o f the Right to Information Act , 200 5 (hereafter ‗the Act‘) . 2. Briefly stated , the relevant facts necessary to address the controversy in this petition are as under: - W.P.(C) 13219/2009 Page 2 of 8 2.1 On 18.0 2.2009, r espondent filed an application under the Act seeking information relating to one Dr Ashok Rawat (one of the employees of MCD). The contents of the said application indicating the information sought by respondent are set out below: - ―Kindly provide the Ass ets and Liabilities of D.H.O. Shahdara North Zone Mr Ashok Rawat Ji. 1. Monthly salary 2. Details of his children with age; how many are school going; their monthly school fee and other expenditure; name of school 3. Whether any transportation is availed of by the children; if yes, give details 4. Whether he is in possession of his own house or in Govt. Accommodation; if it is on private rent the details of the rent agreement be supplied. 5. Whether he has any immovable property in his name, his wife‘s name or in the nam e of his children.‘ 6. Whether any immovable property was purchased after entering into service in MCD in Delhi. 7. Details of property which was disclosed by him at the time of joining. 8. Details of anything more than Rs.10,000/ - which was purchased by him during his service, with date when the appropriate disclosure was made to the department and the same was duly assessed in his assessment of the financial year. 9. Whether the Government vehicle was being utilised for personal use or not.‖ 2.2 Initially, by a letter d ated 17.03.2009, the Public Information officer (PIO) of MCD decline d to provide any information, inter alia, stating that W.P.(C) 13219/2009 Page 3 of 8 the information as sought by respondent was not ‗information ‘ as defined under Section 2(f) of the Act. 2.3 The respondent‘ s application was transferred to the concerned PIO by a letter dated 25.05.2009. Thereafter, the concerned PIO of MCD sent a letter dated 18.06.2009 declining to provide information sought at serial nos.5, 6 and 7 in the RTI application, for the following reasons: - ―The information sought for by the applicant through this point, being secret documents/information which cannot be disclosed in the absence of a general or special order, under provisions of GIO (S.O. 114) under sub -rule (1) of Rule 18 of CCS (Conduct) rul es. 964 Clause 110 of the ―Manual of Office Procedure ‖, Rule 11 of CCS (Conduct) Rules, 1964 as the information sought for herein covers under section 8(j) of the RTI Act, 2005.‖ 2.4 Aggrie ved by the same, respondent preferred an appeal before the First Appellate Authority (hereafter ‗the FAA‘) impugning the action of the PIO in denying the information sought. The FAA partially allowed the appeal by an order dated 20.05.2009 directing disclosure of information sought at serial nos.2 and 3 in the RTI application . 2.5 Aggrieved by the non -disclosure of the complete information as sough t, respondent preferred a second a ppeal under Section 19(3) of the Act. 2.6 The said appeal was allowed by the impugned order and the C IC has directed disclosure of all information pertaining to queri es at serial nos.1 and 4 to 9. The CIC rejected MCD ‘s contention that the information as sought for by respondent was exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act. The CIC was of the view that disclosure of information W.P.(C) 13219/2009 Page 4 of 8 pertaining to assets of pu blic servant s which is collected by a public authority cannot be construed as invasion o f the priv acy of an individual. 3. Ms Biji Rajesh , learned counsel for the MCD conten ded that information regarding the personal assets of its employee s is required to be treated as confidential and merely because employee s of MCD are required to disclose their assets to MCD, the same would not exc lude such information from the scope of Section 8(1)(j) of the Act. She referred to the decision of a Coordinate Bench of this Court in Allahabad Bank v. Nitesh Kumar Tripathi : 2013 SCC OnLine Del 2491 in su pport of her contention. She also referred to the d ecisions of the Supreme Court in Girish Ram chandra Deshpande v. Central Information Commission &Ors.: 2013 (1) SCC 212 and R. K. Jain v. Union of India & Anr.: (2013) 14 SCC 794 . 4. Mr V K Sharma, the learned counsel for the respondent stated that he was no longer pressing for disclosure of the information as initially sought by the respondent and had limited his request to information sought at serial nos.5, 6 and 7 in his RTI application. The said information being (a) wheth er Dr Ashok Rawat held any immovable property in his name; (b) whether any immovable property was purchased by him after entering service with MCD in India including Delhi; and (c) the details of his properties at the time o f joining of service with MCD. Mr Sharma further stated that although at serial no.5 , respondent had sought information as to the immovable property in the name of Dr Ashok Rawat 's wife and children as well; he was no longer seeking that information. 5. In view of the above, the only quest ion required to be addressed is whether MCD is obliged to disclose details of the immovable propert ies W.P.(C) 13219/2009 Page 5 of 8 held by its employees or whether such information is exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act. 6. Before proceeding further, it would be relevant to refer to Section 8 (1)(j) of the Act which reads as under: - ―8. Exemption from disclosure of information . —(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citiz en,— xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx (j) information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may b e, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifie s the disclosure of such information. ‖ 7. It is apparent from a plain reading of Clause (j) of Section 8(1) of the Act that personal information which has no relationship to any public activity or intere st would be exempt from disclosure . However, such information can be disclosed provided that the PIO or the Appellate Authority un der the Act is satisfied that larger public interest justifies such disclosure. In the present case there is no reason to beli eve that disclosure of information sought by respondent is for s ome larger public interest. Respondent has not provided any credible justification for seeking information rega rding the personal assets of the MCD employee in question. Although, it has been contended that disclosure of assets of public servants and their families would serve to stem corruption , however , in the present case , no particular facts have been disclosed by respondent which will indicate that the information so ught would serve a larger public purpose. In view of the above, the only question that needs to be answered is whether the information sought by respondent qualifies to be ―personal W.P.(C) 13219/2009 Page 6 of 8 information ‖, the disclosure of which has no relationship with any public activity or interest. 8. In Girish Ramchandra Deshpande (supra ), the Supreme Court had examined the question whether the CIC was correct in d enying information pertaining to service career , details of assets and liabilities and movable and immovable properties of the respondent therein (who was employed as an enforcement officer) on the ground that the information sought , fell within the scope of ‗personal information‘ . Answering the aforementioned question in the affirmative, t he Supreme Court held t hat the said details sought for, which were denied by the CIC , qualif ied to be personal information as defined in Clause (j) of Section 8(1) of the Act. 9. In Secretary General, Supreme Court of India v. Subhash Chandra Agarwal: AIR 2010 Del 159 , a full Bench of this Court observed that the objective of freed om of information and objective of protecting personal privacy would often conflict when an applicant seeks access to personal information of a third party . The Court held that the Act had recogni zed the aforesaid conflict and had exempted personal information from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act . However, such bar preventing disclosure of personal information could be lifted if sufficient public interest was shown. The relevant extract of the sa id decision is reproduced below: - ―114. There is an inherent tension between the objective of freedom of information and the objective of protecting personal privacy. These objectives will often conflict when an applicant seeks access for personal information about a third party. The confli ct poses two related challenges for law makers; first, to determine where the balance should be struck between these aims; and, secondly, to determine the mechanisms for dealing with requests for such information. The conflict between the right to personal privacy and the public interest in the disclosure of personal information was recognized by the legislature by W.P.(C) 13219/2009 Page 7 of 8 exempting purely personal information under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act. Section 8(1)(j) says that disclosure may be refused if the request perta ins to ―personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual.‖ Thus, personal information including tax returns, medical records etc. cannot be disclosed in view of Section 8(1)(j) of the Act. If, however, the applicant can show sufficient public interest in disclosure, the bar (preventing disclosure) is lifted and after duly notifying the third party ( i.e. the individual concerned wit h the information or whose records are sought) and after considering his views, the authority can disclose it. The nature of restriction on the right of privacy, however, as pointed out by the learned single Judge, is of a different order; in the case of p rivate individuals, the degree of protection afforded to be greater; in the case of public servants, the degree of protection can be lower, depending on what is at stake. This is so because a public servant is expected to act for the public good in the dis charge of his duties and is accountable for them. 115. The Act makes no distinction between an ordinary individual and a public servant or public official. As pointed out by the learned si ngle Judge ― ----- an individual‘s or citizen‘ s fundamental rights, which include right to privacy - are not subsumed or extinguished if he accepts or holds public office.‖ Section 8(1)(j) ensures that all information furnished to public authorities – including personal information [such as asset disclosures] are not give n blanket access. When a member of the public requests personal information about a public servant, - such as asset declarations made by him – a distinction must be made between personal data inherent to the person and those that are not, and, therefore, a ffect his/her private life. To quote the words of the learned single Judge ―if public servants ---- are obliged to furnish asset declarations, the mere fact that they have to furnish such declaration would not mean that it is part of public activity, or ―i nterest‖. ----- That the public servant has to make disc losures is a part of the system‘ s endeavour to appraise itself of potential asset acquisitions which may have to be explained properly. However, such acquisitions can be made legitimately; no law bars public servants from acquiring properties or investing their income. The obligation to disclose W.P.(C) 13219/2009 Page 8 of 8 these investments and assets is to check the propensity to abuse a public office, for a private gain.‖ Such personal information regarding asset disclosures ne ed not be made public, unless public interest considerations dictates it, under Section 8(1)(j). This safeguard is made in public interest in favour of all public officials and public servants. ‖ 10. There can be no doubt that the inform ation sought by respond ent is personal inf ormation concerning an employee of MCD . Such inf ormation could be disclosed only if respondent could establish that disclosure of such information was justified by larger public inter est. Even if the PIO was satisfied that disclosure of such inform ation was justified, the PIO was required to follow the procedure given under Section 11 of the Act; that is, the PIO was required to give a notice to the concerned employee stating that he intends to disclose the information and invite the empl oyee to make submissions on the question whether such information ought to be disclosed. 11. In view of the above, the impugned order directing the disclosure of personal information relating to the employee of MCD cannot be sustained. The impugned order is, accordingly, set aside . 12. MCD has already paid cost of ₹5000/ - and this Court does not consider it apposite to direct refund of the same. 13. The petition along with the pending application is disposed of.

Petitioner Through:Mr.Rajesh Kumar, Advocate versus GYANENDER KUMAR SHUKLA ..... Respondent Through: None CORAM: HON'BLE MR . JUSTICE V.K.JAIN JUDGM ENT V.K.JAIN , J. (ORAL) In WP(C) No.906/2012, the respondent before this Court filed an application seeking certain information, including details of the assets declared by all officers above Scale -III of the petitioner bank. The said application was r esponded by the CPIO of the petitioner bank on 12th August, 2011. However, even before receipt of WP(C) 906/12 and 1191/12 Page 2 of 7 the reply from the CPIO, the respondent had already preferred an appeal before the first Appellate Authority. Vide order dated 26th August, 2011, the First Appellate Authority noticing that the appeal had been preferred even before disposal of the application by CPIO, directed that a copy of the reply of the CPIO be sent to the appellant before him. In compliance of the said order, the petitioner bank provid ed a copy of its earlier decision to the respondent vide its letter dated 5th September, 2011. The respondent before this Court preferred a Second Appeal before the Central Information Commission and also made a complaint to it under Section 1 8 of the RTI Act. Vide impugned order dated 1st February, 2012, the Commission , inter alia, directed as under: - “….. Therefore we can state that disclosure of information such as assets of a Public servant, which is routinely collected by the Public authority and rou tinely provided by the Public servants, - cannot be construed as an invasion on the privacy of an individual. There will only be a few exceptions to this rule which might relate to information which is obtained by a Public authority while using extraordin ary powers such as in the case of a raid or phone -tapping. Any other exceptions would have to be specifically justified. Besides the Supreme Court has clearly ruled that even people who aspire to be public servants by getting elected have to declare thei r property details. If people who aspire to be public servants must declare their property details it is only WP(C) 906/12 and 1191/12 Page 3 of 7 logical that the details of assets of those who are public servants must be considered to be diclosable. Hence the exemption under Section 8(i)( j) cannot be applied in the instant case.” Being aggrieved from the order passed by the Commission, the petitioner is before this Court by way of this petition. 2. In WP(C) No.1191/2012, the respondent before this Court preferred an appeal under Section 19 of the RTI Act before the First Appellate Authority alleging therein that no information had been supplied to him pursuant to his application dated 18/19 May, 2011 , though the statutory period of 30 days had already expired. The First Appellate Author ity, vide its letter dated 19th August, 2011 informed the respondent that no such application had actually been received by their PIO. Thereupon, the respondent made a complaint dated 18th August, 2011 to the Central Information Commission alleging therei n that no information had been provided to him pursuant to his application dated 18th May, 2011 addressed to the CPIO of the petitioner bank. A copy of the said complaint was forwarded to the petitioner by the Under Secretary of the Commission for giving its explanation in the matter. On receipt of the copy of the complaint of the respondent, the CPIO of the petitioner responded by its communication dated 1st October, 2011. However, the information with respect to assets and liabilities of the officers i n Gramin Bank, Triveni, Gramin Bank, Head Office Orrai and WP(C) 906/12 and 1191/12 Page 4 of 7 Allahabad UP Gramin Bank , Head Office Banda was not supplied to the respondent. The said complaint was disposed of by the Commission, vide its order dated 10th February, 2012. During the course o f hearing of the complaint, the Commission noted the contention of the petitioner that it had supplied the required information except the information with respect to the assets and liabilities of the employees and details of the TA Bills. The Commission, vide impugned order dated 10th February, 201 2 directed the PIO of the petitioner bank to provide information as about assets to the complainant. 3. Thus, the only question involved in these petitions is whether the information with respect to the assets and liabilities which an employee furnishes to his employer can be directed to be disclosed under RTI Act. Section 8 (1) (j) of the Act reads as under: - “ (j) information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfie d that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information: Provided that the information which cannot be denied to the Parliament or a State Legislature shall not be denied to any person. ” WP(C) 906/12 and 1191/12 Page 5 of 7 It would, thus, be seen that an information which has no relationship to any public activity or interest of the employee concerned or which would cause some unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual cannot be directed to be disclosed unless the CPIO/PIO or the Appellate Authority is sati sfied that larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information. 4. The question whether information with respect to the assets and liabilities of an employee exempted under Section 8 (1)(j) of the Act or not came up for consideration before the Apex Court in Girish Ramchandra Deshpande Vs. Cen. Information Commr. and Ors. (2013) 1 SCC 212. In the case before the Supreme Court, the Commission had denied details of the assets and liabilities, movable and immovable property of an employee on th e ground that the information sought qualified to be „personal information ;, as defined in Clause (j) of Sectio n 8 (1) of the Act. Aggrieved by the order passed by the Commission, the appellant before the Supreme Court, preferred a writ petition which cam e to be dismissed by the Single Judge. An appeal preferred by him was also dismissed by a Division Bench of the High Court. Being aggrieved form the order passed by the Division Bench, he approached the Apex Court by way of Special Leave. Dismissing the Special Leave Petition, the Apex Court, inter alia, held as under: - “…14.The details disclosed by a person in his income tax returns are "personal information" which stand exempted from WP(C) 906/12 and 1191/12 Page 6 of 7 disclosure under Clause (j) of Section 8(1) of the RTI Act, unless involves a larger public interest and the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the Appellate Authority is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information. ” 5. It would, thus, be seen that the information with respect to the assets and liabilities of an employee, which he discloses to his employer in compliance of the Service Rules applicable to him qualifies as personal information within the meaning of Section 8(1)(j) of the Act and such information cannot be directed to be disclosed unless the CPIO/PIO/Appellate Authority is satisfied that larger public interest justifies disclosure of such information. It goes without saying that such satisfaction needs to be recorded in writing before an order directing disclosure of the information can be passed. A perusal of the impugned orders would show that in neither of these cases, the Commission was satisfied that larger public interest justified disclosure of the information sought by the applicant/respondent. Without being satisfied that larger public interest justified disclosure of the information sought in this regard, the Commission could not have passed an order directing disclosure of information of this nature. The order s passed by Central Informat ion Commission are , therefore, liable to be set aside on this ground alone. The impugned orders are accordingly set aside. The writ petition stands disposed of. There shall be no orders as to costs. WP(C) 906/12 and 1191/12 Page 7 of 7 6. The petitioner had deposited Rs.5000/ - each which could be incurred by the respondent. Since the respondent has not put in appearance despite service, there will be no justification for paying the said amoun t to him. It is, therefore, directed that the aforesaid amount shall be deposited by the Registry with Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee. V.K. JAIN, J JULY 09 , 2013 ks

Petitioner Vs The Tamil Nadu State Information Commissioner, O/o. The State Information Commission, No.2, Thiyagaraya Salai Road, Teynampet, Chennai ? 18. .. Respondent Prayer: Writ Petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, praying this Court to issue a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus calling for records relating to the impugned order passed by the respondent in Valakku No.24699/Visaranai/B/2013 (40916/B/2013) (22707/B/2014) dated 21.01.2016 and quash the same as illegal and for a consequential direction to the respondent to provide information as sought by the petitioner in his application dated 15.03.2013 under the Act within a period that may be stipulated by this Hon'ble Court. !For Petitioner : Mr.M.E.Ilango ^For Respondent : Mr.K.K.Senthil :ORDER This Writ Petition has been filed challenging the impugned order dated 21.01.2016 and consequential direction to the respondent to provide information as sought by the petitioner in his application dated 15.03.2013 under the Act within the stipulated time. 2.According to the petitioner, he has sought information under the Right to Information Act before the authority concerned but the same was not provided. Therefore, he preferred an appeal before the appellate authority wherein also the information sought by the petitioner has not been provided. Hence, he was constrained to approach the respondent to get the information by way of second appeal. But the respondent has also not properly answered the query of the petitioner. Hence, he filed a Writ Petition in WP(MD)No.5756 of 2015 to dispose of the second appeal and this Court byA.Kanagaraj vs The Tamil Nadu State Information ... on 21 April, 2016 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21788648/ 1order dated 16.04.2015 disposed of the said Writ Petition. In pursuance of the same, the respondent has disposed of the Second Appeal but he has passed the order without any application of mind and not giving final quietus to the matter and further it contained an observation not submitted by the petitioner. Hence, the petitioner has come forward with the present Writ Petition challenging the same. 3.A perusal of the impugned order would very clearly show that in the enquiry conducted on 29.12.2015 for the non-issuance of the documents an enquiry was sought for calling upon the officers why penalty should not to be imposed in respect of one L.Murthy, erstwhile P.A. to Collector and S.Sundararaj, Special Tahsildar (Special Scheme Implementation) who is also retired. On the same day, the petitioner was also directed to be present and he has also participated in the enquiry. The very impugned order itself states that the petitioner has sought for information regarding five items from the District Collector's office, Theni. But, only one item was given full information and in respect of items 2 and 3 wrong information have been given and in respect of items 4 and 5 no information was given but yet it was informed as information was given and the person who assisted the petitioner in the enquiry viz., Manikandan has specifically stated before the authority concerned that the Commissioner has no power excepting directed to issue a copy of the document. Whereas contra, the respondent has categorically stated that even as early as on 16.07.2015 the entire information as sought for by the petitioner has been given. In this connection, both the persons who have been accused against have retired on 31.03.2013 and 31.05.2013 respectively. In fact, as per the order itself, the first officer has categorically stated that when the application was received on 19.03.2013 as per Section 6(3) within five days it was referred to and sought information from the District Land Survey Department as the information sought for is in violation of Rule 7(9). When action being taken he retired on 31.03.2013. Therefore, at that point of time, he could not give the explanation sought for and for that penalty cannot be imposed was the explanation given by the then officer. The second officer also stated that since the petitioner requires documents pertaining to the third parties belonging ownership of lands and which contains huge quantity of information which could not be collected within the period of one month and also stated that he could not collect the information due to his retirement as he was also retired on 31.03.2015. Hence, he sought for not to take any action against him. 4.The authority after considering all these factors and taking into consideration that the petitioner was also granted the information in accordance with law and his contention that the Public Information Officer be punished cannot be accepted in the explanation offered by the officers. The explanation offered was correct as they have very clearly pointed out that insofar as the first officer is concerned within the stipulated time he has initiated action to give information but in the meantime he retired. The Second officer is concerned, he was able to prove before the authority concerned that the information sought for is too much which could not be collected within the stipulated time. In any view of the matter, the authority having convinced that the information officers have not committed any offence that cannot now be challenged by the petitioner on the ground that the punishment was not imposed. In this connection, it is relevant to rely upon the decision of this Court reported in 2011 (8) SCC 492 [A.Kanagaraj vs. The Principal Commissioner and Commissioner of Land Administration, Chepauk, Chennai] wherein following the order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court it has been clearly held that how the Right to Information Act is beingA.Kanagaraj vs The Tamil Nadu State Information ... on 21 April, 2016 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21788648/ 2abused. The relevant portion in paragraph 6 of the order reads as under: ?6. .... 37.The right to information is a cherished right. Information and right to information are intended to be formidable took in the hands of responsible citizens to fight corruption and to bring in transparency and accountability. The provisions of RTI Act should be enforced strictly and all efforts should be made to bring to light the necessary information under clause (b) of section 4(1) of the Act which relates to securing transparency and accountability in the working of public authorities and in discouraging corruption. But in regard to other information, (that is information other than those enumerated in Section 4(1)(b) and (c) of the Act), equal importance and emphasis are given to other public interests (like confidentiality of sensitive information, fidelity and fiduciary relationships, efficient operation of governments, etc.,). Indiscriminate and impractical demands or directions under RTI Act for disclosure of all and sundry information (unrelated to transparency and accountability in the functioning of public authorities and eradication of corruption) would be counter-productive as it will adversely affect the efficiency of the administration and result in the executive getting bogged down with the non- productive work of collecting and furnishing information. The Act should not be allowed to be misused or abused, to become a tool to obstruct the national development and integration, or to destroy the peace, tranquility and harmony among its citizens. Nor should it be converted into a tool of oppression or intimidation of honest officials striving to do their duty. The nation does not want a scenario where 75% of the staff of public authorities spends 75% of their time in collecting and furnishing information to applicants instead of discharging their regular duties. The threat of penalties under the RTI Act and the pressure of the authorities under the RTI Act should not lead to employees of a public authorities prioritising 'information furnishing', at the cost of their normal and regular duties. Conclusion, 38.In view of the foregoing, the order of the High Court directing the examining bodies to permit examinees to have inspection of their answer books is affirmed, subject to the clarifications regarding the scope of the RTI Act and the safeguards and conditions subject to which 'information' should be furnished. The appeals are disposed of accordingly. Therefore, I do not find any reason to interfere with the reasoned order passed by the respondent. The Writ Petition is dismissed. No costs.

Relevant Facts emerging during Hearing: The following were present Appellant: Gita Dewan Verma Respondent: Mr.Hansraj representing PIO Mr. S. K. Saxena and Mr. Manoj Kumar The first hearing was held on 5th November, 2008, when considering the points raised by the appellant it was decided to adjourned the hearing to 14th November, 2008 at 2.00PM. On 14th November, 2008 the following persons were present: Appellant: Gita Dewan Verma Respondent: Mr.Hansraj representing PIO Mr. S. K. Saxena and Mr. Manoj Kumar The key issues identified in the appellants second appeal on page 3 are as follows: (a) Does the agreement between GNCTD and CDP Consultant come under S.8(1)(d) or could it have been given with the Work Order (based on / in continuation of the Agreement) for complete reply to my request no. 5a (‘Letter commissioning CDP to IL&FS Ecosmart Ltd.”) ? = The Commission asked the respondent to justify our Section 8(1)(d) would apply to the agreement between GNCTD & CDP Consultants. The respondent stated that agreements are matters where commercial information of the Consultant is shared. The Commission asked the respondent to give a note giving its arguments in support of using this exemption. The Commission did not see this exemption as very obvious as made out by the respondent. Besides the respondent has not given any reasoning as to how Section 8(1)(d) applies in this case. (b) Do CDP Consultant submissions for various stages of payment come under S.8(1)(d) or could copies/particulars have been given in reply to my request no.5b (‘Letter by which IL&FS submitted final CDP’) ? = The appellant seeks to know if there were cove ring letters attached to various submissions. The Commission is asked the PIO to supply the covering letters accompanied with any of the submissions. In case there are no covering letters with some of the submissions this will be stated categorically. (c) Does information about ‘State Level Steering Comm ittee’ and its pr ocedures (whereby notice for its meeting is channel of submission and its ‘end orsement’ in unconfirmed minutes is approval) come under S.4(1)(b) and should it have been given for complete reply to my request nos.5c, d&e (records of submission and approval of CDP) = The PIO has been asked to give the information to the appellant whether there is any written procedure for the State Level Steering Committee. If there is no such procedure the PIO will state this clearly. (d) Was GNCTD obliged to obtain under S.2(f) and supply on my request s nos.2 & 3 information “for each of” who were consulted or submitted EOI/myself rather than general remarks about all, as given.? = The PIO has been asked to send the letter to IL &FS asking if there was any written down criteria by which participants were selected or rejected for the work shop and provide the answer to the appellant. (e) Is supply of CDP on CD “subject to condition” of no publication (to me) same “without publication authorization” (to Centre for Civil Society, on website of which CDP is published and which has also distributed further copies on CD) and, if CDP copyright “is with the Government”, ought copy on CD to have been refused (to all) under Section 8(1)(d)? = The appellant’s query insisting that the PIO must give a reply authorising her to publish the CD given to her can not be considered as a request for information as defined under the Act. The appellant is actually seeking a decision from the PIO and the way she has worded it can not be construed as seeking information under the Act. The PIO has been asked to send the answers to a,b,c& d to the appellant with a copy marked to the Commission by 30th November, 2008. The appellant may send the rejoinder to the Commission and to the Respondent by 10th December, 2008. After this matter will be decided finally by the Commission.

1 AFR HIGH COURT OF CHHATTISGARH, BILASPUR WPC No. 997 of 2019 Vidyadhar Mishra S/o Satyadev Mishra Aged About 68 Years R/o In front of Railway Station Raipur Dist. Raipur Chhattisgarh --- Petitioner Versus 1.State of Chhattisgarh through Secretary, State Information Commission, Nirmal Chhaya Bhawan Meera Dataar Road, Shankar Nagar, Raipur Chhattisgarh 2.Shri J.S. Armo, Registrar Office, Collectorate Campus, Raipur Chhattisgarh (First Appellate Authority). 3.Shri P.K Chivram, Registrar Office Collectorate Campus Raipur Chhattisgarh (Public Information Officer) --- Respondents Amicus Curiae : Shri Kshitij Sharma, Advocate For Petitioner :Shri Raj Kumar Pali, Advocate For Respondents/State :Shri Sudeep Verma, Dy.G.A. For Respondent No.3 :Mr. Shyam Sundar Tekchandani, Adv. Hon'ble Shri Justice Goutam Bhaduri Order On Board 09-05-2019 1.The present petition is against the order dated 24-05-2014 passed by the Chief Information Commissioner, Raipur in appeal proceeding No.A/2861/2013 whereby the second appeal was rejected. The petitioner initially on 24/09/2013 sought information that at village Fafadih Tahsil & District Raipur, Mr. Satyadev and Jagnarayan son of Raja ram Mishra owned a land bearing Khasra No. 2292 ad-meauring 2.02 acres. It was stated that the said land was sold between the year 1935 and 1943 and 2 two informations/details were sought i.e., (A) in between period of 1935-1943 on what date parts of land were sold and to whom ? (B) The certified copies of the sale deeds thereof may be provided. 2.The said application was rejected by the Information Officer of the office of Sub-Registrar, Raipur on 11/10/2013. The petitioner preferred First Appeal before the appellate authority i.e. Registrar under Section 19 of the Right to Information Act on 02/11/2013. The appellate authority too dismissed the appeal and thereafter the second appeal was preferred before the Chief Information Commissioner on 04/2/2014. The said appeal was dismissed by impugned order dated 24/05/2014 on the ground that particulars of the information sought for has not been provided and information so required is in the form of questionnaire and therefore the information can not be supplied. 3.Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the information so sought for is comprised within the records of Sub- Registrar and it will be covered under the definition of of 2(f) of the Right to Information Act 2005 as such by denial of information, the illegality has been committed. Consequently the respondent may be directed to supply such information to the petitioner. 4.Shri Kshitij Sharma, Advocate, was requested to assist the Court and was appointed as Amicus Curiae. He argued the case at length. Referring to definition under sub-section (f) & (g) of section 2 of the Act, it is contended that the information under the Act of 3 2005 can only be furnished when the authorities are required to keep the same and they are required to maintain such information in their official records under the particular Act itself or any other law. It is further submitted that since the case pertains to registration of immovable property consequently it will have reference to Indian Registration Act and the rules made there- under. Referring to Section 51, 55 & 57 of the Indian Registration Act, it is stated that the particulars so sought for do not fall categorically under the said Sections since no particulars were given about the transaction. It is further submitted that Section 57 of the Registration Act 1908, the petitioner could have searched the documents and thereafter could have given the particulars with respect to the Rules framed under the Act, styled as C. G. Registration Rules 1939. It is contended that Rule 87 of Rules 1939 mandates that the books and index shall be kept in the Registration Office which do not particularly require and if it is read with Appendix B which is form of Book No.1 it only contemplates the name of Village, Tahsil and District i.e., territorial description and nature and value of the instrument. Therefore, to obtain information of the like nature, the petitioner should have established that the information which is sought for is preexisting on the record. The reliance was placed in (2011) 8 SCC 497 Para 63 & 67 – Central Board of Secondary Education Vs. Aditya Bandopadhyay and submits that under the circumstances, if such a request for information as sought by way of indiscriminate and impractical demands or direction under the RTI Act is acceded to, it would be counter productive as it would adversely affect the 4 efficiency of the public authority and result in the executive/public authority getting bogged down with the non-productive work of collecting and furnishing information. Therefore, the order dated 24.05.2014 is well merited. 5.Counsel for respondent No. 1 would submit that the information sought for was in form of questionnaire and in absence of any particulars the Public Officer is not expected to search for on behalf of the petitioner and thereafter give the information. He further submits that if such request is acceded to then the particular government office will be completely rendered non- productive. Learned State counsel also supports the contention of the respondents. 6.Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the documents. parties. 7.The information which was sought for by the petitioner was in respect of the query that one Satya Dev and Jagnarayan son of Rajaram Mishra owned a land bearing Khasra No. 2292 ad- meauring 2.02 acres at village Fafadih, Tahsil & District Raipur wherein petitioner sought for information that in between the period of 1935-1943 how many sales were made and to whom and how much parts were sold ? 8.The second information was sought for as to when the particulars of such sale deeds are recovered then the certified copy of such sale deeds be supplied to him. The said application was dismissed by the information officer which was subject of First Appeal and the First Appellate Authority too dismissed the contention of the 5 petitioner which was further taken up in the Second Appeal wherein the impugned order dated 24/05/2014 was passed. 9.Section 2(f) of the Right to Information Act 2005 defines the “information” which reads as under : “Information” means any material in any form, including records, documents, memos, e-mails, opinions, advices, press releases, circulars, orders, logbooks, contracts, reports, papers, samples, models, data material held in any electronic form and information relating to any private body which can be accessed by a public authority under any other law for the time being in force” 10. Section 2(j) defines the Right to Information. The reading of Section 2(f) would show that information which is sought for must be pre-exisiting on the records of the public authorities under any law for the time being in force. Since the issue in hand relates to registration of the sale deed by the office of Sub Registrar and the information was sought for, section 51 of the Registration Act 1908 would be relevant which reads as under : 51. Register-books to be kept in the several offices.- (1) The following books shall be kept in the several offices hereinafter named, namely :- A-- In all registration offices -- Book 1, “Register of non-testamentary documents relating to immovable property”. Book 2, “Record of reasons for refusal to register” Book 3, “Register of wills and authorities to adopt” and Book Book 4, “Miscellaneous Register”. B-In the offices of Registrars – Book 5, “Register of deposits of wills” 11.The query of petitioner would fall under the Book-1 which relates 6 to Register of non-testamentary documents relating to immovable property. Thereafter, section 52 of the Registration Act 2008 speaks of the duties of registering officers when document is presented and thereafter section 55 would be relevant which speaks of “indexes” to be made by the registering offices and their contents. Relevant part of section 55 for the purpose of this case is reproduced here-in-below : “55. Indexes to be made by registering officers, and their contents. -- (1) Four such indexes shall be made in all registration offices, and shall be named respectively, Index No.1, Index No.II, Index No.III and Index No.IV. (2) Index No.I shall contain the names and additions of all the persons executing and of all persons claiming under every document entered or memorandum filed in Book No.1” 12.Section (2) of section 55 stipulates that Index No.1 shall contain the names of and additions of all persons who execute the document. Index No.II shall contain such particulars mentioned in section 21. The Rules which is framed and styled as C.G. Registration Rules, 1939. Rule 87 mandates that the books and indexes shall be kept in registration offices and the Appendix -B which forms registration of book etc., would show that the registering officer is required to record the names of territorial description of the property. The information which was sought for by the petitioner was in nature of questionnaire meaning thereby in order to provide the information, the office of Sub-Registrar was required to make a search on behalf of the petitioner and thereafter take out the information and then supply it to petitioner. Section 57 of the Registration Act, 1908 prescribed that subject to 7 previous payments of the fee, Book Nos. 1 & 2 and the Indexes relating to Book No.1 shall be open to inspection by any person applying to inspect the same. 13.In the instant case, it appears that from the kind of information as sought for, the petitioner wanted to pass his questionnaire buck on the registration office so as to search out the sale made in a particular period and thereafter give this information by obtaining the copy of it. If such request is acceded to by indiscriminate and impractical demands or directions under the RTI Act for disclosure of such information, then in view of the expression made by the Supreme Court in (2001) 8 SCC 497, it would be a counter productive as it will adversely affect the efficiency of administration of public authority and further result in executive or public authority getting bogged down with the non-productive work of collecting and furnishing information. For ready reference, Paras 63 & 66 of the said decision are relevant and quoted below: “63. At this juncture, it is necessary to clear some misconceptions about the RTI Act. The RTI Act provides access to all information that is available and existing. This is clear from a combined reading of section 3 and the definitions of “information” and “right to information” under clauses (f) and (j) of Section 2 of the Act. If a public authority has any information in the form of data or analysed data, or abstracts, or statistics an applicant may access such information, subject to the exemptions in Section 8 of the Act. But where the information sought is not a part of the record of a public authority, and where such information is not required to be maintained under any law or the rules or regulations of the public authority, the Act does not cast an obligation upon the public authority, to collect or collate such non-available information and then furnish it to an applicant. A public authority is also not required to furnish information which require drawing of inferences 8 and/or making of assumptions. It is also not required to provide “advice” or “opinion” to an applicant, nor required to obtain and furnish any “opinion or “advice” to an applicant. The reference to “opinion” or “advice” in the definition of “information” in Section 2(f) of the Act, only refers to such material available in the records of the public authority. Many public authorities have, as a public relation exercise, provide advice, guidance and opinion to the citizens. But that is purely voluntary and should not be confused with any obligation under the RTI Act.” “67. Indiscriminate and impractical demands or directions under the RTI Act for disclosure of all and sundry information (unrelated to transparency and accountability in the functioning of public authorities and eradication of corruption) would be counterproductive as it will adversely affect the efficiency of the administration and result in the executive getting bogged down with the non-productive work of collecting and furnishing information. The Act should not be allowed to be misused or abused, to become a tool to obstruct the national development and integration, or to destroy the peace, tranquility and harmony among its citizens. Nor should it be converted into a tool of oppression or intimidation of honest officials striving to do their duty. The nation does not want a scenario where 75% of the staff of public authorities spends 75% of their time in collecting and furnishing information to applicants instead of discharging their regular duties. The threat of penalties under the RTI Act and the pressure of the authorities under the RTI Act should not lead to employees of a public authorities prioritising “information furnishing” at the cost of their normal and regular duties.” 14.In view of the decision of the Supreme Court in C.B.S.E. v. Aditya Bandopadhyay (supra) the information so sought for by the petitioner was in questionnaire in nature and unless and until it is established that certain information exists in the documents, in the index, the officers cannot be directed to make a roving enquiry on behalf of the petitioner to make such information available to 9 him. When the Act provides means and measure to get the information as a statutory right then instead of doing it in self, it cannot be passed on to the officer of department to do so in the garb of RTI Act 2005. The RTI cannot be misused to pass on a duty of applicant to be done by officer concerned and to allow enjoy a joy ride to the petitioner. The application itself was misconceived. Hence, the order impugned do not require any interference. Accordingly, the petition is dismissed. 15. Before parting with the case, the Court extends sincere thanks to Mr. Kshitij Sharma, Amicus Curiae for rendering valuable assistance to the Court. Sd/- GOUTAM BHADURI R a o JUDGE Book

THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT MADRAS Dated: 17.04.2013 Coram THE HONOURABLE Mr. JUSTICE ELIPE DHARMA RAO AND THE HONOURABLE Mr. JUSTICE M.VENUGOPAL W.P.No.20485 of 2012 and M.P.No.1 of 2012 The Registrar General, High Court of Madras, Chennai 600 104. .. Petitioner Vs. 1.K.Elango 2.The Registrar, The Tamil Nadu Information Commission, No.2, Sir Thyegaraya Salai, Teynampet, Chennai 600 018. .. Respondents (R2 impleaded as per order dated 04.10.2012 in M.P.2/2012) PRAYER: Petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India pr aying for an issuance of a Writ of Certiorari calling for the records in Case No.10447/Enquiry/A/11 dated 10.01.2012 of the Tamil Nadu Information Commission and quash the same. For Petitioner : Mr.S.Haja Mohideen Gisthi For 1st Respondent : Party in Person For 2nd Respondent : Mr.G.Rajagopalan, Senior Counsel For M/s.G.R. Associates ORDER M.VENUGOPAL,J. The Petitioner has preferred the instant Writ Petition as against t he order dated 10.01.2012 in Case No.10447/Enquiry/A/11 dated 10.01.2012 passed by the Tamil Nad u Information Commission, Chennai. 2.The Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Chennai, in Case No.10447/Enquiry/A/11 dated 10.01.2012 has, among other things, observed that 'A perusal of the appeal and the replies furnished by the public authority shows that the appellant has only asked for details relating to the number of subordinate Judges, employees, compliants of b ribe and so on in the subordinate judiciary. He has not asked for details of anything whi ch could be termed as Judicial proceedings or part of the Judicial process. During the en quiry it was also confirmed by the Assistant Public Information Officer that these details are received and co llected by the Registry of the High Court routinely. Section 4 of the RTI Act very clearly defines t he obligation of the public authorities. Most of the information sought for b y the present appellant seem to be covered in this section. Such being the case the Hon'ble High Court,M adras, being a public authority, requires to provide access to these information unless expressly p rohibited by a Competent forum or exempted as defined under various sections of the RTI Ac t. It is also observed that the appellant has asked only for statistical details and n ot names of individuals. Therefore, the argument of "un warranted invasion of privacy of individual s" is very weak and hence not accepted' and resultantly, allowed the appeal by directing t he public authority (Writ Petitioner) to furnish the details within 15 days from the date of r eceipt of this order. 3.According to the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner/Registrar General, High Cou rt of Madras, the impugned order dated 10.01.2012 in Case No.10447/Enquiry/A/11 passed by the Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Chennai is legally void and therefore, it is liable to be set aside. 4.The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner urges before this Court that the impugned order has been passed in violation of the provisions of the Right to Information Act, 2005 and as such, it is void ab initio. 5.The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner contends that the Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Chennai, while passing the impugned order dated 10.01.2012, has faile d to appreciate an important fact that the information sought for b y the 1st Respondent/Petitioner is infringing the internal administration of Hon'ble High Court of Madras. 6.Yet another submission of the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that if the request of the 1st Respondent/Petitioner is acceded to by the High Court of Ma dras, then, it will set a bad precedent for others. 7.Per contra, the 1st Respondent/Petitioner submits that he has enrolled as an Advocate in the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry in the year 1986 an d is practising before the High Court of Madras and before the trial Courts in Chennai. Also that, he is engaged in various social activities. Furthermore, he was appointed as an Assistant Solicitor Genera l of India in the High Court of Madras during the period 2008-2009. He served as Special Govern ment Pleader for the Tamil Nadu State during the year 2006 - 2008. 8.According to the 1st Respondent/Petitioner that he is the legal advisor of several Residents' Welfare Associations and Traders' Welfare Associations at K.K. Nagar, Chennai 600 078. He served as President of Rotary Club of Madras, T.Nagar (2005-2006) and General Secretary of Anti Bribe Coalition, (a public trust) a wing of EXNOR A international and an active member of India Against Corruption. 9.The 1st Respondent/Petitioner contends that he approached the Public Information Officer of the High Court, Madras to find out the mechanism and struct ure the High Court has to take action against the corrupt employees and the Presiding Officers of the Subordinate Judiciary and sought certain information, by means of queries, as referred in para 3 of the Affidavit filed by the Writ Petitioner. 10.According to the 1st Respondent/Petitioner, the information sought for by him are all matters defined under Section 2(f) of the Right to Information Act, 2005. As a matter of fact, those information do not come within Section 8 of the Right to Information Act, 2005. 11.The 1st Respondent/Petitioner lodged an Appeal dated 20.12.2010 before the Appellate Authority (Writ Petitioner). But the Appellate Authority had n ot furnished information sought for by him vide his letter dated 01.11.2010. As such , he was perforced to prefer Second Appeal to the Information Commissioner on 18.03.2011. The 2n d Respondent/Tamil Nadu Information Commission, through its direction dated 23.03.2011, has transmitted the petition dated 16.03.2011 of the 1st Respondent for taking appropriate action. Also, the 2nd Respondent/Information Commission has sought the remarks of the Writ Petitioner/Registrar General by 27.04.2011 for the said petition. The Registrar (Administration)/Public Information Officer of the Petitioner/H igh Court sent a reply dated 27.04.2011 to the Registrar of the 2nd Respondent/Information Commission stating t hat the remarks called for in the matter would be furnished shortly. However , the Writ Petitioner (Appellate Authority), on 29.04.2011, sent a letter to the Information Commission (marking a copy to him) denying the information. However, the Tamil Nadu Information Commi ssion, Chennai passed an order on 10.01.2012 directing the Petitioner/Appella nt to furnish the informations to the 1st Respondent/ Petitioner. 12.The Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the 2nd Respondent/Tamil Nadu Information Commission submits that the 1st Respondent/Petitioner, as a ci tizen, has a statutory right, to obtain the informations sought for by him, throu gh his Letter dated 01.11.2010 addressed to the Public Information Officer of the Writ Pet itioner/High Court. Further, Section 4 of the Act speaks of 'Obligations of the Public Aut hority'. As such, the informations sought for by the 1st Respondent/ Applicant through hi s Letter dated 01.11.2010 do squarely come within the purview of Section 4 of the Act. 13.The Learned Senior Counsel for the 2nd Respondent urges before this Court that Section 22 of the Right to Information Act enjoins that the provisi ons of the Act have an overriding effect on the Official Secrets Act, 1923 (19 of 1923) and any other law for the time being in force etc. Viewed in that perspective, it is contended that the informations sought for by the 1st Respondent/Petitioner, by his Letter dated 01.11.2010, can be supp lied by the Petitioner/High Court, because of the reason that he has sought for statis tical particulars and names of individuals concerned. In short, the Learned Senior Counsel for the 2nd Respondent contends that the impugned order dated 10.01.2012 passed by the Tamil Nad u Information Commission does not suffer from any impropriety or illegality, in the eye of law . 14.The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner submits that the informatio n sought for by the 1st Respondent/Petitioner in his application dated 01.11.2010 addres sed to Public Information Officer of High Court relates to the internal administratio n of the Madras High Court and the information sought for by the 1st Respondent/Petition er from Serial Nos.1 to 9 in his application dated 01.11.2010, if furnished would cause an invasi on of privacy of the individuals. Therefore, under the ingredients of Section 8(e) and (f) of the Act, the Writ Petitioner is exempted to disclose the information sought for. Also, as per Se ction 8(i) of the Act, the Petitioner/High Court is exempted to disclose the information sought for by the 1st Respondent/Petitioner. 15.To lend support to the contention that the information sought for by the 1st Respondent/Petitioner, in his application dated 01.11.2010 addressed to th e Public Information Officer of High Court, Madras, cannot be acceded to by the Petitioner, the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner cites the order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sp ecial Leave Petition (Civil) No.27734 of 2012 (@ CC 14781/2012) dated 03.10.2012 between Girish Ramchandra Deshpande V. Cen. Information Commissioner & Others, wherein in paragraphs 12 to 16, i t is observed and laid down as follows: "12. The petitioner herein sought for copies of all memos, show cause notices and censure/punishment awarded to the third respondent from his employer and also details viz. movable and immovable properties and also the details of his investments, len ding and borrowing from Banks and other financial institutions. Further, he has also sought for the details of gifts stated to have accepted by the third respondent, hi s family members and friends and relatives at the marriage of his son. The information mostly sought fo r finds a place in the income tax returns of the third respondent. The question that has come up for consideration is whether the above-mentioned information sought for qualifies to be personal informationas defined in clause (j) of Section 8(1) of the RTI Act. 13. We are in agreement with the CIC and the courts below that the detai ls called for by the petitioner i.e. copies of all memos issued to the third respondent, show cause notices and orders of censure /punishment etc. are qualified to be personal informat ion as defined in clause (j) of Section 8(1) of the RTI Act. The performance of an employee/o fficer in an organization is primarily a matter between the employee and the employer and normally those aspects are governed by the service rules which fall under the expression person al information, the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activi ty or public interest. On the other hand, the disclosure of which would cause unwarranted invasion of p rivacy of that individual. Of course, in a given case, if the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer of the Appellate Authority is satisfied that th e larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information, appropriate orders could b e passed but the petitione r cannot claim those details as a matter of right. 14. The details disclosed by a person in his income tax returns are personal in formationwhich stand exempted from disclosure under clause (j) of Section 8(1) of the RTI Act , unless involves a larger public interest and the Central Public Information Officer or the Stat e Public Information Officer or the Appellate Authority is satisfied that the larger publ ic interest justifies the disclosure of such information. 15. The petitioner in the instant case has not made a bona fide publ ic interest in seeking information, the disclosure of such information would cause unw arranted invasion of privacy of the individual under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act. 16. We are, therefore, of the view that the petitioner has not succeeded in establishing that the information sought for is for the larger public interest. That bei ng the fact, we are not inclined to entertain this special leave petition. Hence, the same is dismissed." 16.The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner also seeks in aid of the ord er of this Court dated 12.02.2010 in W.P.Nos.8068 and 8069 of 2008 between M.Velayutham V. T he Registrar, Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Teynampet, Chennai- 18 & 3 others, wherein in paragraphs 10 and 11, it is observed and held as follows: "10.Before closing the case it must be noted that whenever a person challen ges the order of the State or Central Information Commission, it is not necessary to make the Commission a party to the writ petition. The Commission is a statutory appellate aut hority and is expected to function within the four corners of the RTI Act. If its orders are under challenge, the Commission is not expected to defend it. In a writ for certiorari the ord er will have to speak for itself. If the Commission is made as a party, it will be an unnecessary drain on t he Commission to engage counsel to defend its orders. In no case a court is expected to d efend its decisions. More often, the Commission's orders are challenged by the Government department s or information officers at the expense of the Government. In these cases, the appl icant who sought the information will be a party and will be expected to defend hi s request. 11.Only for the purpose of calling for records or sending a copy of t he order, the Information Commission need not be made as a party. If the persons who do not file proper records, then a notice may be sent by the Registry to call for the records if ordered by th e courts. Likewise, on complicated matters if any legal assistance is required, the Court can ap point an 'amicus curiae' to help the Court. The orders of the Court on all matters involvin g the Right to Information Act, as a matter of routine, can be marked to the appropriate Commission. The Registr y shall henceforth must ask the counsel who files writ petitions to dele te the Information Commission from the array of parties. This will not only reduce the paper work and administrative difficulties faced by the Commission, besides saving them draining their mea gre resources." 17.The 1st Respondent/Petitioner, in his Application dated 01.11.2010 addressed t o the Public Information Officer of the High Court, Madras, has sought the following information by raising queries to be furnished to him. They are as follows: "1.How may Subordinate Judges are there in service in the state of Tamil Nadu . The district- wise list may be furnished to me as per the hierarchy? 2.How may employees are serving in the judicial department in the whole of Tamil Nadu (including the Government servants on deputation)? 3.How many judicial officers, police officers and staffs are working in the Vi gilance Department of the registry of Madras High Court? 4.Does your vigilance department is having any branches in the district so as to receive the complaint from the general public against the judicial officer and court staffs? 5.Does your registry is having any tie up or coordination with the of fice of Vigilance and Anti- corruption, Rajaannamalai Puram, Chennai 28 to trap the judicial officers or co urt staffs on the basis of the complaints from the affected persons? 6.Does your registry is having special team for trapping the corrupt judicial of ficers and court staffs? 7.Between 2001 to 2010 how many complaints have been received by your Registry and Vigilance Department, kindly give complaint wise break up figure ( that is how many complaints against DJ, ADDLJ, SJ, DMC, FTC Judges, Magistrates and Court staffs)? 8.How many complaints ended in dismissal, suspension, issuance of memo and droppi ng of the case and conviction between the said 2001 to 2010? 9.Between 2001 to 2010 how many complaints against High Court staffs have b een received relating to bribe and the fate of those complaints?" 18.It transpires that the 1st Respondent/Petitioner has filed an Ap peal under Section 19 of the Right to Information Act, 2005 on 20.12.2010 before the Appella te Authority (Writ Petitioner). Since the Public Information Officer of the High Court had not furnished him the required information sought for by him through his letter dated 01.11.2010. In the Appeal filed by the 1st Respondent/Petitioner before the Appellate Authority (Writ P etitioner) dated 20.12.2010, he had sought for the information earlier sought for by him as per his Application dated 01.11.2010. Inasmuch as the 1st Respondent/ Petitioner was not furn ished with the requisite informations sought for by him, by the Writ Petitioner/Appel late Authority, he filed Second Appeal before the Tamil Nadu State Information Commission, Chennai praying for issuance of a direction to the Writ Petitioner/Appellate Authority to furnish the informations, as sought for by him, in his letter dated 01.11.2010 with cost and penalty t o be imposed. 19.The Tamil Nadu Information Commission in Case No.10447/ Enquiry/A/20 issued summons dated 16.03.2011 to the Public Information Officer of the High Cou rt, Madras requiring him to appear before the Commission in person along with all original records on 21.12.2011 at 3.30 p.m. for further consideration of the matter. 20.The Tamil Nadu Information Commission, on 10.01.2012 in Case No.10447/Enquiry/A/11 passed an order by not accepting the argument "un warran ted invasion of privacy of individuals" and allowed the Appeal by directing the Petitioner/Public Authority to furnish the details sought for by the 1st Respondent /Petitioner within 15 days from the date of receipt of this order. 21.It is to be borne in mind that under the Right to Informat ion Act, 2005 as an authority has a rudimentary function to perform either to furnish the information or d eny the information. As a matter of fact, there is no specific Article in the Constitution of India which provides for the citizens right to know. However, Article 19(1)(a) provides for free dom of thought and expression which indirectly includes right to obtain information. Further, Article 21 guarantees right to life and personal liberty to citizens. Undoubtedly, Right to Life is incomplete if basic human right viz., 'Right to Know' is not included with in its umbrage. 22.Right to information is seen in Article 19(1)(a), 14 and 21 of the Consti tution. 23.It is not out of place for this Court to point out that S ections 1 and 2 of the Right to Information Act, 2005 deal with title, commencement and definitions of important terms employed under the Act. Sections 6 and 7 specified procedure for su bmitting the requisition for obtaining information and disposal of applications. Section 8 deals with cases of exemption from disclosure of information, when such disclosure affects prejudicial the sovereignty and integrity of India etc. Section 9 deals with Grounds for rejection of ap plications. Section 18 deals with the Powers and Functions of the Central Information Commission or the State Information Commission as the case may be. 24.It is to be noted that Section 2(e) of the Right to Informat ion Act, 2005 defines the term 'Competent authority' meaning, "(i) the Speaker in the case of the House of the People or the Legisl ative Assembly of a State or a Union territory having such Assembly and the Chairman in the case of the Cou ncil of States or Legislative Council of a State; (ii) the Chief Justice of India in the case of the Supreme Court; (iii) the Chief Justice of the High Court in the case of a High Court; (iv) the President or the Governor, as the case may be, in the case of other authorities established or constituted by or under the Constitution; (v) the administrator appointed under article 239 of the Constitutio n." 25.Section 2(f) of the Act defines 'Information' as follows: "(f) information means any material in any form, including records, d ocuments,memos, e-mails, opinions, advices, press releases, circulars, orders, logbooks, contracts, reports, papers, samples, models, data material held in any electronic form and informati on relating to any private body which can be accessed by a public authority under any other law for the time being in force." 26.Also, Section 2(h) of the Act means 'Public Authority' as under: "any authority or body or institution of self government established or const ituted- (a) by or under the Constitution; (b) by any other law made by Parliament; (c) by any other law made by State Legislature; (d) by notification issued or order made by the appropriate Government, and includes any- (i) body owned, controlled or substantially financed; (ii)non-Government organisation substantially financed, directly or in directly by funds provided by the appropriate Government; (i) recordincludes- (a) any document, manuscript and file; (b) any microfilm, microfiche and facsimile copy of a document; (c) any reproduction of image or images embodied in such microfilm (whether enlarged or not); and (iii)(d) any other material produced by a computer or any other devic e." 27.Section 2(j) of the Act defines 'Right to Information' meaning, "the right to information accessible under this Act which is held by o r under the control of any public authority and includes the right to- (i) inspection of work, documents, records; (ii) taking notes, extracts or certified copies of documents or records; (iii) taking certified samples of material; (iv) obtaining information in the form of diskettes, floppies, tapes, video cassettes or in any other electronic mode or through printouts where such information is stored in a computer or in any other device." 28.As per Section 6 of the Right to Information Act, if a person desires to obtain an information shall make a request in writing or through electron ic means in English or Hindi or in the official language along with prescribed fee to the concerned public authority. 29.It is true that the applicant is not required to furnish an y reason requiring the information or any personal details except those that may be necessary for the purpose of contacting him. 30.Soon after the receipt of request for supplying/furnishing of in formation, the Central Public Information Officer/State Public Information Officer is to d eal with the matter in issue within 30 days. If the information sought for relates to the life o r liberty of an individual, the same is to be provided within 48 hours of the receipt of request. If t he concerned officer fails to render his decision within 30 days or 48 hours as the case may be, he shall be deem to have refused the request. 31.In case, the information is to be furnished on payment of any fee, the Officer is required to send an intimation to the requisitionist together wi th relevant particulars of fee. 32.If a physically challenged person requires an access to the record, th en, the Officer is to provide an assistance to enable him to get an access to the inf ormation. Indeed, no fee is to be charged in regard to the persons who are below the poverty line. However, i f the public authority fails to provide information within the specified li mits which are to be provided on payment of fee, it shall be provided free of charge. 33.Where a request has been rejected, the concerned officer is to comm unicate the reasons for denying the request, the time limit within which an Ap peal may be filed and the relevant particulars of the Appellate Authority to the concerned in dividual who has made the request. 34.It cannot be gainsaid that under the Right to Information Act , 2005, the Public Information Officer concerned is an independent authority, in l aw. If the said Officer fails to furnish the informations sought for by the concerned Applicant, with in the time specified under the Act, then, in law, it amounts to deemed rejection/denial of request . However, if the Public Information Officer malafidely denies/rejects the request of an Applic ant either wholly or in part, then, he can be proceeded with under the Right to Informat ion Act, 2005. 35.For denying the information as per Section 8(e) of the Right to Inform ation Act, 2005, the following paramount factors may be taken into consideration. (a)Whether supplying/furnishing information on public records w ould impede the investigation/apprehension/prosecution; (b)Whether the information is such that can be refused/denied t o Parliament or State Legislature; (c)Whether public interest in disclosure earns the protected interest ; (d)Section 22 of the Right to Information Act has an overriding eff ect and as such, the legal procedure enshrined for quasi judicial proceedings gets overridden by the Right to Information Act. 36.In this connection, this Court worth recalls the decision of the Hon'ble Suprem e Court in Namit Sharma V. Union of India [2013-2-L.W.1 at page 2] wherein it is l aid down as follows: "The Right to Information, like any other right, is not an unlimite d or unrestricted right. It is subject to statutory and constitutional limitations. The doctrin e of severability finds place in the statue in the shape of Section 10 of the Act of 2005". 37.Indeed, Section 18 of the Right to Information Act deals with t he Powers and Functions of the Commission. Section 18(3) of the Right to Information Act, 2005 enjoins as follows: "(a) summoning and enforcing the attendance of persons and compel them to give oral or written evidence on oath and to produce the documents or things; (b) requiring the discovery and inspection of documents; (c) receiving evidence on affidavit; (d) requisitioning any public record or copies thereof from any court or office; (e) issuing summons for examination of witnesses or documents; and (f) any other matter which may be prescribed." Also, Section 18(4) of the Act, runs thus: "(4)Notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in any oth er Act of Parliament or State Legislature, as the case may be, the Central Information Commission or the State Information Commission, as the case may be, may, during the inquiry of any compl aint under this Act, examine any record to which this Act applies which is und er the control of the public authority, and no such record may be withheld from it on any grounds. " 38.From the reading of the ingredients of Section 18 of the Act, it is c rystal clear that the State Information Commission has power to conduct an enquiry in a given c ase. It is to be remembered that the Information Commission is only required to find out whether the endorsement issued by the Public In formation Officer is in confirmit y with the Right to Information Act, 2005 and whether the information which is sought for has been intentionally/deliberately held back or the same has not been furnishe d within the specified time. 39.It is to be pointed out that in an Appeal filed under Section 19 of the Act, under Section 18(4) of the Act, the State Information Commission before passing an ord er (relating to an information of a third party) has to issue a Notice to the t hird party for the purpose of providing a reasonable opportunity [obviously, in terms of the Princi ples of Natural Justice]. Coming to Section 20 of the Act, in regard to the imposition of penal ty under Section 20 of the Act, the same is undoubtedly penal in nature. Before awarding any penalty, on an Official/Officer, a reasonable opportunity is to be provided to the d eviant concerned. However, the directions/recommendations of the State Information Commission to initiate action against an deviant/ errant Public Information Officer are not binding on the appropriate authority. It is purely within the ambit of the Public Authority/ Competent Auth ority either to concur with the directions/ recommendations so issued/made or not to concur with t he same. 40.It cannot be gainsaid that the Information Commission exercises judicial powers and it is a Tribunal entrusted with the task of adjudicating upo n special matters and disputes between the parties. The Commission is a Tribunal vested with the appell ate power to decide the appeals etc., as per the decision in Poornaprajna House Building Co-o perative Society Limited V. Karnataka Information Commission & others, [AIR 2007 Karnataka 136]. Furthermore, in the said decision at page 136, it is observed as follows: "It is settled that any authority or body of persons constituted by law or having legal authority to adjudicate upon questions affecting the rights of a subject an d enjoined with a duty to act judicially or quasi judicially is amenable to the certiorari jurisdic tion of the High Court. Similarly, Art. 227 of the Constitution confers on every High Court the power of sup erintendence over all Courts and tribunals throughout the territories in relation to whi ch it exercises jurisdiction excepting any Court or tribunal constituted by or under any law relatin g to armed forces. Thus, the orders of the Commission are amenable to the jurisdiction of the Hi gh Court." 41.In the decision Ahmedabad Education Society & Another V. Union o f India & Others, [AIR 2008 Gujarat 42 at page 44], it is inter alia observed as follows: "Looking to the provisions of Section 18 of the Act,2005, State Chief Information Commissioner can hold an inquiry and can impose penalty upon erring officer. No order can be passed against the third party otherwise right of first appeal as well as second appeal of third party will be taken away. Looking to the facts of the present case, it is clear that the State Chief Information Commissioner has exceeded his jurisdiction under the Act,2005. (iv) Order passed without giving an opportunity of being heard, lead to arbitrariness. Arbitrariness and equality are sworn enemies of each other. Where arbitrariness is present, equality is always, absent and where equality is present, arbitrariness is absen t. In the facts of this case, there is gross violation of principles of natural justice. Henc e, the order is arbitrary and ,therefore, is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India." 42.This Court aptly points out the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Namit Sharma V. Union of India, [2013-2-L.W.1] at special page 41 & 42, in paragraphs 99 to 102, wherein it is observed as follows: "99.Persons of eminence in public life is also an expression of wid e implication and ramifications. It takes in its ambit all requisites of a good citizen with values and having a public image of contribution to the society. Such person should have understandi ng of concepts of public interest and public good. Most importantly, such person shou ld have contributed to the society through social or allied works. The authorities cannot lose si ght of the fact that ingredients of institutional integrity would be applicable by n ecessary implication to the Commissions and their members. This discussion safely leads us to conclude that the functions of the Chief Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners may be better performed by a legally qualified and trained mind possessing the requisit e experience. The same should also be applied to the designation of the first appellate authority, i.e., the senior officers to be designated at the Centre and State levels. However, in view of language of Section 5, it may not be necessary to apply this principle to the designation of Public Information Officer. 100. Moreover, as already noticed, the Information Commission, is performing qu asi-judicial functions and essence of its adjudicatory powers is akin to the Court system. It also possesses the essential trappings of a Court and discharges the functions which h ave immense impact on the rights/ obligations of the parties. Thus, it must be termed as a judic ial Tribunal which requires to be manned by a person of judicial mind, expertise and experienc e in that field. This Court, while dealing with the cases relating to the powers of the Parl iament to amend the Constitution has observed that every provision of the Constitution, can be amended provided in the result, the basic structure of the Constitution remains the sam e. The dignity of the individual secured by the various freedoms and basic rights contained i n Part III of the Constitution and their protection itself has been treated as the basic structure of the Constitution. 101. Besides separation of powers, the independence of judiciary is of fun damental constitutional value in the structure of our Constitution. Impartial ity, independence, fairness and reasonableness in judicial decision making are the hallmarks of the Jud iciary. If Impartiality is the soul of Judiciary, `Independence' is the life blood of Ju diciary. Without independence, impartiality cannot thrive, as this Court stated in the case of Union of India v. R. Gandhi, President, Madras Bar Association [(2010) 11 SCC 17]. 102. The independence of judiciary stricto sensu applies to the Court system. Thus, by necessary implication, it would also apply to the tribunals whose fun ctioning is quasi-judicial and akin to the court system. The entire administration of justice system has to be so independent and managed by persons of legal acumen, expertise and experience t hat the persons demanding justice must not only receive justice, but should also have the faith that justice would be done." Also, in the aforesaid decision at page 42 in paragraph 103, it is held as follows: "103. The above detailed analysis leads to an ad libitum conclusion that under the provisions and scheme of the Act of 2005, the persons eligible for appointment sh ould be of public eminence, with knowledge and experience in the specified fields and should preferably have a judicial background. They should possess judicial acumen and experience to fairl y and effectively deal with the intricate questions of law that would c ome up for determination before the Commission, in its day- to-day working. The Commission satisfies abecedarians of a judicial tribunal which has the trappings of a court. It will serve t he ends of justice better, if the Information Commission was manned by persons of legal expertise and with adeq uate experience in the field of adjudication. We may further clarify that suc h judicial members could work individually or in Benches of two, one being a judicial memb er while the other being a qualified person from the specified fields to be called an expert member. T hus, in order to satisfy the test of constitutionality, we will have to read in to Section 12(5) of the Act that the expression knowledge and experienceincludes basic degree in that field an d experience gained thereafter and secondly that legally qualified, trained and experienced p ersons would better administer justice to the people, particularly when they are expected to undertake an adjudicatory process which involves critical legal questions and niceties of law. Such appreciation and application of legal principles is a sine qua non to the determinative functioning of the Commission as it can tilt the balanc e of justice either way. Malcolm Gladwell said, the key to good decision making is not knowledge. It is understanding. We are swimming in the former. We are lacking in the latter. The requirement of a judicial mind for manning the judicial tribunal is a well accepted discipline i n all the major international jurisdictions with hardly with any exceptions. Even if the intenti on is to not only appoint people with judicial background and expertise, then the most suitable and prac tical resolution would be that a judicial member and an expert memberfrom other specified fields sho uld constitute a Bench and perform the functions in accordance with the provisions o f the Act of 2005. Such an approach would further the mandate of the statute by resolving the legal issues as well as other serious issues like an inbuilt conflict between the Right to Pr ivacy and Right to Information while applying the balancing principle and other incidental co ntroversies. We would clarify that participation by qualified persons from other specified fields would b e a positive contribution in attainment of the proper administration of justice as well as the object of the Act of 2005.Such an approach would help to withstand the challenge to the constit utionality of Section 12(5)." 43.At this stage, we deem it appropriate to cite the following deci sions in furtherance of substantial cause of justice: (a)In the decision Kunche Durga Prasad and another V. Public Information Officer, Office of Chief Manager (HR) Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited, Rajamundry & others, [AIR 2010 Andra Pradesh 105] at page 106 in paragraph 6 and 7, it is observed as follows: "6.Neither the 1st petitioner nor any other unsuccessful applicants have f iled application before the 1st respondent pointing out any grievance. The 2nd respondent, who is an advocate, filed the application seeking information as referred to above. The 1st re spondent furnished information on 13.02.2009 wherein it was mentioned that 73 SC candidat es were selected; not an individual officer but a committee has selected the candidates; a nd a list indicating the particulars of posting orders of all the 284 candidates was furnished . So far as the request to furnish the copies of qualification certificates submitted b y the selected candidates is concerned, the 1st respondent took the view that such an info rmation is exempted under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act. The 2nd petitioner filed an appeal under Section 19 of the Act before the 3rd respondent. The latter upheld the view taken by the 1st resp ondent. Therefore, it needs to be seen as to whether the information sought for by the 2nd p etitioner i.e. furnishing copies of the qualification certificates of the selected candidates is no t exempted under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act. The said provision reads as under: 8. Exemption from disclosure of information: -- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen,- ........ (j) information which relates to personal information the disclosure of wh ich has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would c ause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or t he State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfi ed that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information: Provided that the information, which cannot be denied to th e Parliament or a State Legislature shall not be denied to any person. 7.From a perusal of the above, it is evident that the exemption gets attract ed under two circumstances namely, (a) if the information is personal in nature and has no relationship to any public activity or interest, and (b) furnishing of the same woul d cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of an individual. These exemptions are, however, subject to the opi nion that may be formed by the Central or State Public Information Officer or the appellat e authority that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such informatio n." Moreover, in the aforesaid decision at page 107, in paragraph 10 and 11, it is observed as follows: "10.The 2nd petitioner is not able to state as to how the copies of qualification certificates of the selected candidates have any characteristics of public activity or par take public interest. The aggrieved parties including the 1st petitioner have already approached this Court b y filing W.P.No.17355 of 2008. Such of the selected candidates who are implead ed in that writ petition would certainly have to defend themselves. Any direction to the respon dents herein to furnish the testimonials of the selected candidates to the petitioners would have its own impact upon the pleadings or the stands which the parties to the pending proceedings may take. It may appear to be enterprising or tempting for any one to have access to every p ossible information for an individual whether it relates to an individual or not. The freedom of an individual to have access to the information cannot be projected to such an extent as to invade the rights of others. Further, Section 6(2) of the Act cannot be read in isolation, no r can be interpreted to mean that an applicant can seek every information relating to an y one. Just as he cannot be compelled to divulge the purpose for which he needs the inf ormation, he must respect the right of the other man to keep the facts relating to him, close to his c hest, unless compelled by law to disclose the same. It is relevant to mention that even where an indivi dual is placed under obligation to speak, the law can only draw adverse inference from his fail ure or refused to speak but cannot go further to invade his privacy or private life. 11.The learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the view t aken by the respondents conflicts with the very spirit of Section 6(2) of the Act. This content ion cannot be accepted for the simple reason that Section 8 of the Act, on one hand, and the Sec tion 6 of the Act, on the other hand, operate in different and distinct fields. Though S ection 6(2) of the Act enables every individual to seek information without disclosing the purpose, the information that can be furnished to him is subject to the restrictions placed under Se ction 8 of the Act. Therefore, no exception can be taken to the impugned orders. (b)In the decision Rajasthan Public Service Commission V. Ms.Pooja Meena & Another, [AIR 2012 Rajasthan 52] at page 53, in paragraph 11, it is observed as follows: "11.To the valued observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, this Court w ould respectfully add that the provisions of RTI Act cannot be used as a tool to give vent to the frustration and dissatisfaction of a citizen as in the present case without anything m ore. The present case relates to RAS Examination 2007, which have long been concluded and ap pointments made thereunder. A dissatisfied candidate who is disbelieving in the process of a constitutional body, ought not be allowed to continue pursuing the RPSC and seek inf ormation which can affect the efficient working and discharge of its constitutional obligati ons without any corresponding benefit or relationship to any public interest or activity. T he impugned order dated 14.10.2010 is a mechanical order and does not disclose a careful consideration of the matter before the Chief Information Commissioner." (c)In Khandapuram Gandaiah V. The Administrative Officer, Ranga Reddy Distri ct Courts and Others, [AIR 2009 Andhra Pradesh 174], at page 178, it is observed that 'Tho ugh Sections 8(1)(b) and 24 of the Act do not provide any exemption to the Jud ges or judicial officers from giving the information sought for' and further, it is held that 'The Petitioner has no locus to raise this contention because he can seek only information under th e Right to Information Act'. 44.Coming to the aspect of non disclosure of information, it is to be p ointed out that the ingredients of Section 8 and 11 of the Right to Information Act, 2 005, there is total bar on 6 out of 10 exceptions i.e. 1(a), (b), (c), (f), (g) & (h). Insofar as the matters covered by Se ction 8(1)(d), (e)(h) and (i) of Section 8 of the Act, the Information Officers are necessaril y to record a finding by taking into account the relative merit between the Public interest and secrecy. If the public interest outweighs private interest, then, the information has to be f urnished. Otherwise, the Officer is entitled to assign reasons for refusing to supply/furnish t he information in question. 45.Coming to the aspect of Right to Information Act, 2005 which h as an overriding effect on the Official Secrets Act, 1923 and any other law for the time being in force with a view to achieve the object of reducing corruption and to maintain transparency in public activity/ dealing, at this juncture, we deem it appropriate to recall the ob servations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mohandas Lalwani V. The State of Madhya Pradesh, [AIR 197 3 Supreme Court 2679 at p.2684], wherein it is observed as under: "... As long as an impression exists that corruption is prevalent and that unless one pays to somebody things are not done, there would be always persons who would f eel the urge to offer bribe. Bribe would be offered not only to get an undue favour b ut also to avoid unnecessary harassment and to see that no obstruction or delay is caused in getting the most legitimate work done. To prevent the repetition of crimes like the one of which the appellant has been found guilty, it is necessary to inculcate a general feeling that things are done in due course uninfluenced by extraneous considerations." 46.Also, we aptly point out the following decisions of the Hon'bl e Supreme Court, to secure the ends of Justice: (a) In Swatantar Singh V. State of Haryana and others, [AIR 1997 Supreme Court 210 5 at p. 2106], it is laid down as follows: "It is sad but a bitter reality that corruption is corroding, like cancerous lymph nodes, the vital veins of the body politics, social fabric of efficiency in the publi c service and demoralising the honest officers. The efficiency in public service would improve onl y when the public servant devotes his sincere attention and does the duty diligently, truthfull y, honestly and devotes himself assiduously to the performance of the duties of his post. The re putation of corrupt would gather thick and unchaseable clouds around the conduct of the officer and gain notoreity much faster than the smoke." (b)In High Court of Judicature at Bombay through its Registrar V. Shi rish Kumar Rangrao Patil and another, [AIR 1997 Supreme Court 2631] at page 2639 & 2640, in paragrap h 16, it is observed as follows: "16.Corruption, appears to have spread everywhere. No facet of public funct ion has been left unaffected by the putrefied stinck of corruption. Corruption, thy n ame is depraved and degraded conduct. Dishonesty is thine true colour; thine corrodin g effect is deep and pervasive; spreads like lymph-nodes, cancerous cells in human body spreading as wi ld fire eating away the vital veins in the efficacy of public functions. It is a sad fact that corruption has its roots and semification in the society as whole. In the widest connotation, corrup tion includes improper or selfish exercise of power and influence attached to a public office. T he root of corruption is nepotism and apathy in control on narrow considerations which o ften extends passive protection to the corrupt officers. The source and succour for acceptab ility of the judgment to be correct, is the upright conduct, character, absolute integrity and displa yed on and off the Bench becomes centre stage of the judicial officer. Fallen standard of rectitude is the bane for lost faith of the people, tending to defeat the constitutional sc heme of conferment of the powers of judicial review or decision according to law unless checks and co rrective measures are applied and enforced. The conferment of exclusive power of judicial review on the judiciary may become means to personal gain or advantage. The Tymph-nodes (cancerous cells ) of corruption constantly keep creeping into the vital veins of judiciary and the need to stem it out by judicial surgery lies on judiciary itself by its self-imposed or corrective m easures or disciplinary action under the doctrine of control enshrined in Articles 235,124(6) of the constitution. It would, therefore, be necessary that there should be cons tant vigil by the High Court concerned on its subordinate judiciary and self-introspection. Wh at is most necessary is to stem out the proclivity of the corrupt conduct rather than to catch when the corrupt demands made and acceptance of illegal gratification. Corruption in jud iciary cannot be committed without some members of the Bar become privy to the corrup t. The vigilant watch by the High court, and many a time by the members of the Bar, is the sust aining stream to catch the corrupt and to deal with the situation appropriately. At the same time the High Court is the protector of the subordinate judiciary. Often some members of the bar, in pa rticular, in Muffasil courts, attempt to take undue advantage of their long stan ding at the bar and attempt to abuse their standing by bringing or attempting to bring about diverse form of pressures and pin-pricks on junior judicial officers or stubborn and stern and unbendable officers. If they remain unsuccessful, to achieve their nefarious purpose, some members of the Bar indulge in mudslinging without any base, by sending repeated anonymous letters again st the judicial officer questioning their performance/capacity/integrity. The High Court sho uld, therefore, take care of the judicial officers and protect them from such unseemi ng attempts or pressures so as to maintain their morale and independence or the judicial offic er and support the honest and upright officers." 47.That apart, in the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in S.P.Gup ta and others V. President of India and others, [AIR 1982 Supreme Court 149], it is held that 'the Right to know has been given a constitutional status by treating it as a part of speech and expression and thereby bringing this right within Art.19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India'. 48.It will be quite in the fitness of things to recall the Golden words of Thomas JefferSon, who rightly said that 'Information is the Currency of Democracy'. 49.In the words Amartya Sen, 'the Right to Information Act, 2005 is a momentous engagement with the possibilities of freedom'. [vide Lawz January 2008 at page 40 sp ecial page 41]. 50.Befittingly, we recall the observation of Lord Goff in the decision Att orney General V. Guardian Newspapers Limited and others (No 2) 1990 1 A.P. at page 109 which runs as follows: " Although the basis of Law's protection of confidence is that there i s a Law, nevertheless the public interest may be outweighed by some other countervailing publ ic interest which favours disclosure." 51.We aptly point out that on going through the tenor of Section 2(f) of the Right to Information Act pertaining to 'Information' stated thereunder, we are of the cocksure opinion that the same does not include within its fold the personal i nformation of the officials, staff members/officers to the public authority viz., High Court, in the instant case on hand. Section 3 of the Right to Information Act, 2005 speaks of 'All citizens to have the right to information, subject to the provisions of the Act'. Section 4 of the Act refers to 'Obl igations of public authorities'. Every public authority under the Act owes a duty to specify reasons of any administrative orders or quasi-judicial decisions to the affected/aggrieved p ersons as per the decision in Satyan A. V. Government of Kerala, [2008 (4) K.H.C. at page 120 & 121]. 52.In the decision B.Bindhu V. Secretary, Tamil Nadu Circle Postal Co-o perative Bank Limited, Chennai, [AIR 2007 Madras 13 at page 14], it is held that 'The peti tioner is not entitled to the details sought for by her under the provisions of the Right to Information Act, 2005'. 53.Under Section 8(1)(j) of the Right to Information Act, 2005 the Offi cers are not required to provide private or personal information which is exempte d. As a matter of fact, the informations relating to employees in High Court/Subordinate Courts/Judi cial Officers etc. are inter se matters between an employer and employee in an institution whic h are purely governed by respective service rules. In fact, it partakes the character of 'personal in formation', the disclosure of the same has no public interest or public activi ty. It cannot be lost sight of that under the concept of 'Right to Know', a Public Information Offi cer is not supposed to be harassed or persecuted/prosecuted. 54.It is to be pointed out that the personal information and th e information between persons in fiduciary relationship is exempted from disclosure under the Ri ght to Information Act. Also, 'Confidence' may be outweighed by public interest in the matte r of such disclosure. 55.The Learned Senior Counsel for the 2nd Respondent cites the decision o f High Court of Delhi in Secretary General, Supreme Court of India V. Subhash Chandra Agarwal, [ 2010 (1) CTC 241] (Full Bench), wherein it is held as under: "Every citizen is entitled to information held by or under Control of Public Authority unless it is exempted by Section 8(1) of the Right to Information Act etc." 56.Moreover, it is held that 'The Resolution of Full Court of the Honourable Supreme Court treating declaration of assets by Judges as confidential does not make it any less information which citizen is entitled to access'. 57.As against the Judgment in L.P.A.No.501/2009, dated 12.01.2010 (by the Full B ench of the Delhi High Court) between Secretary General, Supreme Court of I ndia and Subhash Chandra Agarwal, the Central Public Information Officer of Supreme Court of India and another (on the file of the Honourable Supreme Court of India) has filed Civil Appeal No.10044 of 2010 (arising out of SLP (C)No.32855 of 2009) and the Honourable Supreme Cou rt with C.A.10045/2010 @ SLP (C)No.32856 of 2009, the Central Public Information Officer of Supreme Court of India and another V. Subhash Chandra Agarwal and Civil Appeal No .2683 of 2010, Secretary General, Supreme Court of India V. Subhash Chandra Agarwal, has framed the following substantial questions of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution for consideration. "1.Whether the concept of independence of judiciary requires and de mands the prohibition of furnishing of the information sought? Whether t he information sought for amounts to interference in the functioning of the judiciary? 2.Whether the information sought for cannot be furnished to avoid any erosion in the credibility of the decisions and to ensure a free and frank expression of honest opinion by all the constitutional functionaries, which is essential for effecti ve consultation and for taking the right decision? 3.Whether the information sought for is exempt under Section 8(i)(j) of th e Right to Information Act? 16. The above questions involve the interpretation of t he Constitution raise great and fundamental issues." and directed the Registry to place this matter before the Hon'ble Chief Just ice of India for constitution of Bench for appropriate strength. 58.We aptly point out the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan V. Ramesh Chand Paliwal and another, [AIR 1998 Supreme Court 1079], it is observed as follows: "Art.229 makes Chief Justice of the High Court the supreme authority in t he matter of appointment of the High Court officers and servants. This Article also confers rule making power on the Chief Justice for regulating the conditions of service of officers and servants of the High Court subject to certain restrictions. The power available to t he Chief Justice of the High Court, under Art. 229, is akin to the power of the Chief Justice o f India under Art. 146. Just as Chief Justice of India is the supreme authority in the matter of Supreme Court Establishment including its office staff and officers, so also the Chief Justice of the High Court is the sole authority in these matters and no other Judge or officer can legally usurp those administrative functions or power." 59.Be that as it may, on a careful consideration of respective contenti ons and on going through the contents of the application dated 01.11.2010 filed by the 1st Respondent/Applicant, this Court is of the considered view that the inf ormation sought for by him in Serial Nos.1 to 9 pertaining to the internal delicate funct ioning/administration of the High Court besides the same relate to invasion of privacy of respective in dividuals if the informations so asked for are furnished and more so, the informations sought for have no relationship to any public activity or interest. Moreover, the informati ons sought for by the 1st Respondent/ Applicant, through his application dated 01.11.2010 addressed to the Public Information Officer of the High Court, Chennai, are not to a fuller extent open to public domain. Added further, if the informations sought for by the 1st Respondent /Applicant, through his letter dated 01.11.2010 addressed to the Public Information Officer of High Court, are divulged, then, it will open floodgates/Pandora Box compelling the Petiti oner/High Court to supply the informations sought for by the concerned Requisitionists as a matter of routine, without any rhyme or reasons/restrictions as the case may be. Therefore, some self restrictions are to be imposed in regard to the supply of informations in this regard. As a matter of fact, the Notings, Jottings, Administrative Letters, Intricate Internal Discussions, Deliberations etc. of the Petitioner/High Court cannot be brought under Section 2(j) of the Right to Information Act, 2005, in our considered opinion of this Court. Also that, if t he informations relating to Serial Nos.1 to 9 mentioned in the application of the 1st Respondent /Applicant dated 01.11.2010 are directed to be furnished or supplied with, then, certainly, it wi ll impede and hinder the regular, smooth and proper functioning of the Institution viz., High Court (an in dependent authority under the Constitution of India, free from Executive or Legislature), as o pined by this Court. As such, a Saner Counsel/Balancing Act is to be adopted in matters relating to the application of the Right to Information Act, 2005, so that an adequate freedom and inbuilt safeguard can be provided to the Hon'ble Chief Justice of High Court [competent a uthority and public authority as per Section 2(e)(iii) and 2(h)(a) of the Act 22 of 2005] in exercising his discretionary powers either to supply the information or to deny the information, as prayed for by the Applicants/Requisitionists concerned. 60.Apart from the above, if the informations requested by the 1st Respondent/Applicant, based on his letter dated 01.11.2010, are supplied w ith, then, it will have an adverse impact on the regular and normal, serene functioning of t he High Court's Office on the Administrative side. Therefore, we come to an irresistible conclusion that the 1st Respondent/Applicant is not entitled to be supplied with the informations/details sought for by him, in his Application dated 01.11.2010 addressed to the Public Info rmation Officer of the High Court, Madras under the provisions of the Right to Information Act. Even on the ground of (i) maintaining confidentiality; (ii) based on the reason that t he private or personal information is exempted from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act, 2005; and (iii) also under Section 8(1)(e) of the Act in lieu of fiduciary relationship maintained by th e High Court, the request of the 1st Respondent/Applicant, through his Letter dated 01.11.2010/Appeal dated 20.12.2010 under Section 19 of the Act to the Writ Petitioner/Appellate Authori ty, cannot be acceded to by this Court. Further, we are of the considered view that the 1st Responden t/Applicant has no locus standi to seek for the details sought for by him, as stated supr a, in a wholesale, omnibus and mechanical fashion in the subject matter in issue, (either as a matter of right/routine under the Right to Information Act) because of the simple reason that he has n o enforceable legal right. Also, we opine that the 1st Respondent/Applicant's requests, thro ugh his Application dated 01.11.2010 and his Appeal dated 20.12.2010, suffer from want of bon afides (notwithstanding the candid fact that Section 6 of the Righ t to Information Act does not either overtly or covertly refers to the 'concept of Locus'). 61.To put it differently, if the informations sought for by the 1st Respondent/Applicant, through his letter dated 01.11.2010/Appeal dated 20.12.2010, are divulged or furnished by the Office of the High Court (on administrative side), then, the secrecy and privacy of the internal working process may get jeopardised, besides the furnishing of said informat ions would result in invasion of unwarranted and uncalled for privacy of individuals concerned. Even the disclosure of informations pertaining to departmental enquiries in resp ect of Disciplinary Actions initiated against the Judicial Officers/Officials of the Subord inate Court or the High Court will affect the facile, smooth and independent running of the ad ministration of the High Court, under the Constitution of India. Moreover, as per Section 2(e) of t he read with Section 28 of the Right to Information Act, the Hon'ble Chief Justice of this Court is empowered to frame rules to carry out the provisions of the Act. In this regard, we poin t out that 'Madras High Court Right to Information (Regulation of Fee and Cost) Rules, 2007' have b een framed [vide R.O.C.No.2636-A/06/F1 SRO C-3/2008] in Tamil Nadu Gazette, No.20, dated 21.05.2 008, Pt.III, S.2. Also, a Notification, in Roc.No.976 A/2008/RTI dated 18.11.2008, has been issued by this Court to the said Rules, by bringing certain amendments in regard to the Name and Designation of the Officers mentioned therein, the same has come into force from 1 8.11.2008. 62.In the upshot of quantitative and qualitative discussions men tioned supra, we hold that the view taken by the 2nd Respondent/ Tamil Nadu Information Commi ssion, Chennai, in Appeal Case No.10447/Enquiry/A/11 dated 10.01.2012 that 'the appellant h as asked only for statistical details and not names of individuals', is per se not cor rect. As such, the conclusion arrived at by the 2nd Respondent/ Information Commission, in allowing the App eal and directing the Petitioner/High Court (Public Authority) to furnish the details within 15 days from the date of receipt of copy of this order, is not sustainable, in the eye of law. Therefore, to prevent an aberration of Justice and to promote substantial cau se of Justice, this Court interferes with the order dated 10.01.2012 in Case No.10447/Enquiry/A/11 passed by the 2nd Respondent/Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Chennai and sets aside the same, to secure the ends of Justice. Resultantly, the Writ Petition is allowed. No costs. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed. Sgl To 1. The Registrar General, High Court of Madras, Chennai 600 104. 2.

This access in the form of the right to infor mation is an essential aspect of a civil and democratic society . The existence of legislation around freedom or right to infor mation has a direct impact on the approac h of government functionaries and potentially prevents abuse of processes by the state. Freedom of infor mation, broadly articulated as right to infor mation in India was enshrined in the Universal Declaration for Human Rights as far back as 1948 where it was included as one of the facets of freedom of expression. Subsequent international instruments also recognized this particular right. After years of movement seeking legislation on right to infor mation, the Indian government enacted the Right to Infor mation Act in 2005. The Right to Infor mation Act was enacted with the objecti ve of “setting out the practical regime of right to infor mation for citiz ens to secur e access to infor mation under the contr ol of pub lic authorities , in order to promote transpar enc y and accountability in the working of ever y pub lic authority .” Despite the novel intentions of the legislature , the implementation of the act has not been smooth at all. The Public Infor mation Officers (PIOs) and the Appellate Authorities (AAs) established under the act deny infor mation arbitrarily without any legal basis under the RTI Act. While lawyers might someho w be able to crack the flawed replies with complex legal arguments , the task is not as easy for people without a legal background. Therefore , it is necessar y that legal infor mation on tackling the illegalities of the PIOs and the AAs is accessed by a wider audience . The current toolkit was born out of the experience of a multitude of people in civil society dealing with arbitrar y and illegal actions of the PIOs and the AAs. The toolkit is simple and easy to understand, and it is recommended that you read the section on how to use this toolkit to better understand the complex legal arguments that go in dismantling the replies of the PIOs . 3|P a g eHo w to use this Toolkit The current toolkit follows a simple format of a problem-solution approac h. It is made from the collecti ve experience of a bunc h of people who have been using RTIs as a main tool for researc h. ● Part I – It firstly delineates impor tant definitions in the Act and their interpretations by various courts. It will be preferable if the reader goes through them. ● Part II – After the definitions , it is necessar y to go through the format of application and appeal. Although there is no hard and fast rule as to how an application is to be filed, the format presents some critical elements which may help in appeal. ● Part III – We then deal with tackling the replies of the PIOs by covering responses against the most common grounds of rejection in our experience . We deal with the rejection of the RTI application on the basis of the provisions of the RTI Act and arguments and cases to tackle them during appeal. Further, we have also dealt with judgments that are usually misinter preted and used as the basis of rejection of applications . ● Part IV – In this part, we have covered the grounds of rejection under respecti ve RTI state rules of Chhattisg arh, Gujarat and Jharkhand and our arguments against the same . 4|P a g eI. General Pr ovisions A. I MPORTANT DEFINITIONS UNDER THE RTI A CT ( WITH CASE LAWS ) Definitions ● Section 2(f) “inf ormation” Section 2(f) “inf ormation”: "infor mation" means any material in any form, including records , documents , memos , e-mails , opinions , advices , press releases , circulars , orders , logbooks , contracts , reports, papers , samples , models , data material held in any electronic form and infor mation relating to any private body which can be accessed by a public authority under any other law for the time being in force . Impor tant case: Ahmed v. CPIO , Ministr y of Human Resource and Development, 2018 SCC OnLine CIC 312 ● Section 2(i) record Section 2(i) record: "record" includes— (a) any document, manuscript and file; (b) any microfilm, microfic he and facsimile copy of a document; (c) any reproduction of image or images embodied in such microfilm (whether enlarg ed or not); and (d) any other material produced by a computer or any other device; ● Section 2(j) “right to inf ormation” Section 2(j) “right to inf ormation”: "right to infor mation" means the right to infor mation accessible under this Act which is held by or under the control of any public authority and includes the right to— (i) inspection of work, documents , records; (ii) taking notes , extracts or certified copies of documents or records; (iii) taking certified samples of material; (iv) obtaining infor mation in the form of diskettes, floppies , tapes , video cassettes or in any other electronic mode or through printouts where such infor mation is stored in a computer or in any other device; B. P ROACTIVE D ISCLOSURE U NDER S ECTION 4 Section 4 requires every public authority (definition of term ‘public authority’ is given under Section 2(h)) to provide all the infor mation that is mentioned in Section 4(1)(b) to the public suo moto (that is, without any request by any individual) through various means of comm unication at regular intervals. Section 4(1)(b) of the RTI Act lists infor mation that the public authorities have to publish by themselv es. This list contains within its ambit a vast array of infor mation. The use of the word “shall” in the provision makes it mandator y and binding on the part of the public authorities to disclose this infor mation on their website or make it easily accessible . This needs to be done in order to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority and to contain corruption. 5|P a g eThis is the greatest weapon while filing an RTI application and an appeal as well. The grounds of rejection reduce drastically if the infor mation sought explicitly covers infor mation to be proacti vely disclosed under this section. In any instance when infor mation is denied by the public authority , we also try to show how the infor mation has to be disclosed under S. 4. For example - refer . C. I MPORTANCE O F S ECTION 6 ● Section 6(2): An applicant making request for infor mation shall not be required to give any reason for requesting the infor mation or any other personal details except those that may be necessar y for contacting him. ● Section 6(3) deals with transfer of RTIs and places the oblig ation to transfer RTIs on the public authority themselv es to the relevant department/authority . Wher e an application is made to a pub lic authority requesting for an infor mation— (i) which is held by another pub lic authority; or (ii) the subject matter of which is mor e closely connected with the functions of another pub lic authority , the pub lic authority , to which such application is made , shall transf er the application or such par t of it as may be appr opriate to that other pub lic authority and infor m the applicant immediately about such transf er D. S EVERABILITY UNDER S ECTION 10 If infor mation is rejected on the ground that it is in relation to infor mation which is exempt from disclosure , then as per Section 10, access can still be provided to specific parts of the entire set of infor mation which does not contain that infor mation which is exempt from disclosure . The PIO needs to let the applicant know of this decision along with reasons , fees, etc. E. C ASE LAW ON IMPORTANCE OF BEING HEARD DURING APPEAL We further submit that taking a decision in the First Appeal without hearing the Applicant is a violation of the principles of natural justice and the spirit of the RTI Act. In the matter of Mr. R. K. Jain vs. Department of Legal Affairs Government of India (File No.CIC/SA/A/2014/000254) the Central Infor mation Commission obser ved the following: “Passing orders in first appeal without hearing or sending hearing notice is ille gal and will render the order inv alid. The Commission has set aside the order of First Appellate Authority for breach of natural justice by denying the appellant a chance of presenting his case and by raising an entir ely a new defence which was never claimed. The Commission recommended to initiate disciplinar y action against the officer who was First Appellate Authority though he retir ed from service.” 6|P a g eII.

Fighting the Illegalities This part of the toolkit will go deeper into tackling the replies of the PIOs . Usually , as has been stated above, the replies of the PIO while rejecting the application are based on incor rect interpretation of law and cases decided by the CIC or the Supreme Cour t. This is also a scare tactic utilized by them as languag e of the law can be daunting for people who are not accustomed to it. Since most of the replies by the PIO are bad in law, challenging these replies is not very difficult. Appellants can refer to the RTI Act, various judgments , the lacunae in the judgments cited by the PIO, the base documents of the relevant subject matter and draft a comprehensi ve reply for the same . The appeal application has to be strong in law as the appellate authorities , like the PIOs , are looking for any reason to reject your appeal. Usually , the only thing that causes fear in them is the languag e of the law realizing that they cannot misinter pret law and randomly cite inapplicable provisions and cases because the appellant knows how to counter each and every argument put forth. In this part, we have tried to cover and tackle as many grounds of rejection as possible . We have further divided this part into two sections . The first section deals with the rejection of the RTI application on the basis of the provisions of the RTI Act or respecti ve RTI state rules, and arguments and cases to tackle them during appeal. The second section deals with judgments that are usually misinter preted and used as the basis of rejection of applications . A. R EJECTION OF A PPLICATIONS ON F LAWED I NTERPRETATION OF L EGAL P ROVISIONS 1. S ECTION 7(9) Section 7(9): An infor mation shall ordinarily be provided in the form in which it is sought unless it would dispr opor tionately diver t the resour ces of the pub lic authority or would be detrimental to the safety or preser vation of the record in question. This section is often erroneously cited by the PIO to reject the application on the grounds that infor mation is not kept in the format as requested by the applicant. It is also used to state that the infor mation sought is voluminous and divert the resources of the public authority . The denial of infor mation on the basis of Section 7 (9) of the Act does not have any basis in law. Denial of infor mation can only be under Section 8 (1) or Section 9. Section 7(9) can be invoked only to state that infor mation in the format demanded by the appellant is not possible . According to the section, if the PIO thinks that substantial resources will be diverted if the infor mation is provided in the format sought, the PIO is bound to provide infor mation in the format that is present with them. Argument against the reply of the PIO: ● Reason stated for denying infor mation is diversion of resources . Mrs. Shema vs Aligarh Muslim (2009) (CIC/OK/A/2008/01256/SG/0937) is strongly relied on. The relevant portion is produced below: - “The denial of infor mation on the basis of Section 11 and Section 7 (9) of the Act was without 1 0|P a g eany basis in law. Denial of infor mation can only be under Section 8 (1) or Section 9.” Section 7 (9) can be invoked only to state that infor mation in the format demanded by the appellant is not possible . However, the PIO would have to offer the infor mation in an alternate format when invoking Section 7 (9). ● For infor mation being voluminous Ms. Bincy Thomas v. East Coast Railw ay, Waltair (2010) (CIC/OP/A/2009/000204-AD) “As for infor mation having been denied since it is voluminous , the Commission holds that Section 7(9) of the Act does not allow denial of infor mation but denial of providing the same in the form in which it has been sought in the event this leads to dispr opor tionate diversion of resour ces of the Pub lic Authority .” 2. S ECTION 8(1)( d) Section 8(1)(d) infor mation including commer cial confidence , trade secr ets or intellectual proper ty, the disclosur e of which would har m the competiti ve position of a third par ty, unless the competent authority is satisfied that lar ger pub lic inter est warrants the disclosur e of such infor mation; The arguments will depend on the facts and circumstances of the case. Usually , infor mation which relate closely to trade secrets or might reveal details of the intellectual proper ty right held are rejected at the outset. Argument against the reply of the PIO No such infor mation has been sought by the applicant which reveals the trade secrets of the intellectual proper ty of the applicant. It does not endang er commercial interests of the third party either . Furthermore , it is in the interest of the larger public that the infor mation sought is revealed as it relates to transparency and accountability of the government. ● The appellant will then specifically need to argue pointwise as to how the infor mation sought does not harm the competiti ve position of a third party - does not concer n commercial confidence , IPR and trade secrets . Cases to be cited: Facts and Applicability 1) If the infor mation sought is regarding a contract or agreement entered into by the state with companies , and such infor mation has been rejected on the ground of section 8(1)(d), then the following case can be cited. Gita Dewan Verma v. Additional Secretar y (UD) Govt. of NCT Delhi (2007) (CIC /WB/A/2007/00830/SG/ 1286) “Any agr eement enter ed into by the Gover nment is an agr eement deemed to have been enter ed into on behalf of the and in the inter est of "W e the people" hence if any citiz en wants to know the contents of such an agr eement, he is in the position of a principal asking his agent to disclose to him the terms of the agr eement enter ed into by the agent on behalf of the principal. No agent can refuse to disclose any such infor mation to his principal. Hence it is inconcei vable that the Gover nment should deny a citiz en's request for disclosur e of an agr eement enter ed into by the Gover nment. Such a denial goes against the estab lished constitutional principles apar t from being untenab le under the provisions of the Right to Infor mation Act, 2005.” 2) If the PIO claims that the infor mation relates to the commercial confidence of a third party or trade secrets . 1 1|P a g eShonkh Technlogies v Maharashtra State Infor mation Commission (2011 (113) BOMLR 2433.) “The infor mation sought is in relation to the decision tak en and the polic y framed for providing the Smar t Cards and if the means to provide the same are by inducting pri vate service providers , then, only details of the agr eements executed with such service providers and the copies ther eof have been sought. In my view , ther e was nothing in the infor mation sought by the Respondent No .4, by which commer cial confidence , trade secr ets or intellectual proper ty is being disclosed, leave alone the disclosur e of which would har m the competiti ve position of a third par ty or it would lead to incitement of an offence. Mer ely because the details of the service providers are to be disclosed and the copies of the agr eements would be provided, that does not mean that their inter ests are har med or their competiti ve position is affected.” 3. S ECTION 8(1)( e ) Section 8(1)(e): Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, ther e shall be no obligation to give any citiz en infor mation availab le to a person in his fiduciar y relationship , unless the competent authority is satisfied that the lar ger pub lic inter est warrants the disclosur e of such infor mation. This provision provides for exemption of infor mation from being disclosed as the infor mation is available to a person in his fiduciar y relationship . In such cases , infor mation can be disclosed only if the authority is satisfied that the larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such infor mation. The infor mation is usually rejected on the grounds that the infor mation sought for by the applicant is available to the concer ned authority in fiduciar y relationship . Argument against the reply of the PIO 1) If the PIO has denied access to infor mation by stating that the infor mation is held in fiduciar y relationship , then showing what constitutes a fiduciar y relationship can be an effecti ve counter argument (we specifically applied this in the EPFO RTIs) In decisions such as Mr . K K Bora vs Employ ees Pr ovident Fund (Decision No. CIC/SG/A/2010/002600/12400), it has been clarified and upheld that for infor mation to be exempted under S. 8(1)(e) “….it is necessar y that the third party should have some choice in supplying the infor mation and should have provided it with the condition of confidentiality .” As was further held in the case, the infor mation held by EPFO is in discharge of a statutor y requirement. “ An equally impor tant characteristic for the relationship to qualify as a fiduciar y relationship is that the provider of infor mation gives the infor mation for using it for the benefit of the one who is providing the infor mation. All relationships usually have an element of trust, but all of them cannot be classified as fiduciar y. Infor mation provided in dischar ge of a statutor y requir ement, or to obtain a job, or to get a license , cannot be consider ed to have been given in a fiduciar y relationship . ” In a recent 2018 decision in the case Na graj Janardhan Patil v. PIO , EPFO , Nasik (CIC/EPFOG/A/2016/294053 - 20 February 2018), the Commission went onto impose penalty on the PIO as the denial of EPFO infor mation on the grounds of it being “personal infor mation ’’ and “third party infor mation ’’ is “illeg al and illogical”. While PIO argued that the infor mation is personal and hence exempted, the CIC Acharyulu obser ved that Public Pr ovident Fund is public inf ormation and should be given under RTI . 1 2|P a g eFurther, in another recent judgment in 2017 titled Shankar Singh v. PIO , EPFO , Jabalpur (CIC/EPFOG/A/2017/314655), the phrase “fiduciar y relationship” was analysed in great detail by the Hon’ble Commission and finally it concluded that presence of a statutor y duty to provide infor mation that has to be distinguished from the fiduciar y relation. The Order cited the Gujarat High Cour t judgment in Rajendra Vasantlal Shah vs. Central Inf ormation Commissioner and Or s (AIR 2011 Guj 70) which had held that any statutor y body serving public good cannot claim to be working in a fiduciar y capacity . 2) General argument in all situations The strong est argument against rejection under this provision can be made by citing section 4(1)(b) which is proacti ve disclosure . If the infor mation sought comes under any of the clauses mentioned in the section, the argument of fiduciar y relationship cannot stand. For example , if infor mation regarding budg et disclosure of a particular department is rejected with the reason that it is against public interest, the applicant can sight section 4(1)(b)(xi) which states that, the authority is bound to publish “the budget allocated to each of its agenc y, indicating the par ticulars of all plans , proposed expenditur es and repor ts on disbursements made”. Rakesh Kumar Singh and others versus Harish Chander , Assistant Director and others Central Infor mation Commission (CIC/WB/A/2006/00469) held that- “The word fiduciar y is deri ved from the Latin fiducia meaning “tr ust, a person (including a juristic person such as Gover nment, Uni versity or bank) who has the pow er and obligation to act for another under circumstances which requir e total trust, good faith and honesty . The most common example of such a relationship is the trustee of a trust, but fiduciaries can include business advisers , attor neys , guardians , administrators , dir ectors of a company , pub lic servants in relation to a gover nment and senior managers of a firm/company etc. The fiduciar y relationship can also be one of moral or personal responsibility due to the superior knowledge and training of the fiduciar y as compar ed to the one whose affairs the fiduciar y is handling . In shor t, it is a relationship wher ein one person places complete confidence in another in regard to a par ticular transaction or one’ s general affairs of business .” It is only if the relationship is of the nature as described above can the infor mation be declined under section 8(1(e). If the relationship does not fulfil the above criteria, then section 8(1)(e) cannot be invoked. In the case of Reserve Bank of India vs. Jayantilal N. Mistr y (Civil Appeal No. 91 of 2015) , the CIC held that, “The exemption contained in Section 8(1)(e) applies to exceptional cases and only with regard to certain pieces of infor mation, for which disclosur e is unw arranted or undesirab le. If infor mation is availab le with a regulator y agenc y not in fiduciar y relationship , ther e is no reason to withhold the disclosur e of the same. How ever, wher e infor mation is requir ed by mandate of law to be provided to an authority , it cannot be said that such infor mation is being provided in a fiduciar y relationship .” 4. S ECTION 8(1)( h ) Section 8(1)(h) (h): infor mation which would impede the process of investig ation or appr ehension or prosecution of offenders Argument against the reply of the PIO 1 3|P a g eIn the case Jiwan Garg vs. PIO, Director General of Police, Punjab , it was held that a vague or general plea that disclosure would impede the prosecution would not be sufficient. “W hether in a par ticular case disclosur e of daily diar y would impede investig ation or prosecution of offenders is a matter of fact, to be judged on merits of each case. No generaliz ed precedent applicab le to all requests for infor mation can be laid. Each case is to be judged on its facts and merits . Section 8 (1) (h) does not grant an automatic exemption from disclosur e of infor mation in each case which is at any stage of investig ation or appr ehension or prosecution of offenders . . . The respondent cannot presume an automatic connection betw een disclosur e and impeding of investig ation or prosecution etc of offenders . The respondent must show , at least prima facie , how disclosur e of daily diar y in fact would result in this consequence. The cause and affect need to be shown by respondent. Delhi High Cour t in W (PC) No . 3144 of 2007, while considering the impor t of Clause 8 (1) (h) of the RTI Act held that, “It is appar ent that the mer e existence of an investig ation process cannot be a ground for refusal of the infor mation; the authority withholding infor mation must show satisfactor y reasons as to why the release of such infor mation would hamper the investig ation process . Such reasons should be ger mane , and the opinion of the process being hamper ed should be reasonab le and based on some material. Sans this consideration, Section 8 (1) (h) and other such provisions would become the haven for dodging demand for infor mation.” 5. S ECTION 8(1)( j ) Section 8(1)(j): Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, ther e shall be no obligation to give any citiz en, infor mation which relates to personal infor mation the disclosur e of which has no relationship to any pub lic acti vity or inter est, or which would cause unw arranted inv asion of the pri vacy of the indi vidual unless the Central Pub lic Infor mation Officer or the State Pub lic Infor mation Officer or the appellate authority , as the case may be, is satisfied that the lar ger pub lic inter est justifies the disclosur e of such infor mation: Provided that the infor mation which cannot be denied to the Parliament or a State Legislatur e shall not be denied to any person. Usually , this section is cited when infor mation regarding a third party is sought. Bear in mind that this section only emphasizes that “ personal infor mation” having no relationship with a pub lic acti vity cannot be sought. Argument against the reply of the PIO 1) The test under this provision Applications seeking ‘personal infor mation ’ cannot be rejected outrightly . For the exemption in section 8(1)(j) to apply , three conditions must be met: 1. The infor mation must be personal third-par ty infor mation 2. It must have no relationship to any public activity or interest, and 1 4|P a g e3. Disclosure of the infor mation must cause an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of a third party. The appellant can then explain the current fact scenario and how the infor mation sought does not fulfil the ingredients of this section. Furthermore , according to section 11, if the part of the infor mation does involve some personal infor mation which might violate privacy of an individual, the same can be severed under section 10 of the Act, and the rest has to be provided. Cases to be cited: Facts and Applicability Conditions as laid out in Union Public Service Commission v R.K. Jain (decided on 6 November , 2012) “(i) The infor mation sought must relate to "Personal Infor mation". Ther efor e, if the infor mation sought does not qualify as personal infor mation, the exemption would not apply; (ii) Such personal infor mation should relate to a third person, i.e., a person other than the infor mation seek er or the pub lic authority; AND (iii) (a) The infor mation sought should not have a relation to any pub lic acti vity qua such third person, or to pub lic inter est. If the infor mation sought relates to pub lic acti vity of the third par ty, i.e., to his acti vities falling within the pub lic domain, the exemption would not apply . Similarly , if the disclosur e of the personal infor mation is found justified in pub lic inter est, the exemption would be lifted, otherwise not; OR (b) The disclosur e of the infor mation would cause unw arranted inv asion of the pri vacy of the indi vidual, and that ther e is no lar ger pub lic inter est involved in such disclosur e.” Conditions as laid out in Mr. Sujit Kumar Mazumder Advocate vs CBI (2011) (CIC/SM/A/2011/000318/SG/13429) 1. It must be personal infor mation: Words in a law should nor mally be given the meaning given in common language. In common language , we would ascribe the adjecti ve 'personal' to an attribute which applies to an indi vidual and not to an institution or a Cor porate. Ther efor e, it flows that 'personal' cannot be related to institutions , organizations or cor porates . Hence Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act cannot be applied when the infor mation concer ns institutions , organizations or cor porates . 2. The phrase 'disclosur e of which has no relationship to any pub lic acti vity or inter est' means that the infor mation must have been given in the course of a pub lic acti vity . Various pub lic authorities in perfor ming their functions routinely ask for 'personal' infor mation from citiz ens , and this is clearly a pub lic acti vity . Pub lic acti vities would typically include situations wher ein a person applies for a job, or gives infor mation about himself to a pub lic authority as an emplo yee, or asks for a per mission, license or authorization, or provides infor mation in dischar ge of a statutor y obligation. 3. The disclosur e of the infor mation would lead to unw arranted inv asion of the pri vacy of the indi vidual. The State has no right to inv ade the pri vacy of an indi vidual. Ther e are some extraordinar y situations wher e the State may be allow ed to inv ade the pri vacy of a citiz en. In those circumstances special provisions of the law apply usually with certain safeguards . Ther efor e, wher e the State routinely obtains infor mation from citiz ens , this infor mation is 1 5|P a g ein relation to a pub lic acti vity and will not be an intr usion on pri vacy. 2) Public bodies such as EPFO cannot claim this exemption (we specifically applied this in the EPFO RTIs) In the case of Nagraj Janardhan Patil v. PIO, EPFO , Nasik (CIC/EPFOG/A/2016/294053 - 20 February 2018), the Commission went onto impose penalty on the PIO as the denial of EPFO infor mation on the grounds of it being “personal infor mation ’’ and “third party infor mation ’’ is “illeg al and illogical”. While PIO argued that the infor mation is personal and hence exempted, the CIC Acharyulu obser ved that “ Public Pr ovident Fund is public inf ormation and should be given under RTI, to an yone who seeks it, even if it is of another per son ”. Further, in Shankar Singh v. PIO , EPFO , Jabalpur (CIC/EPFOG/A/2017/314655), the Central Infor mation Commissioner Prof. M. Sridhar Acharyuluha further ordered that infor mation regarding the Provident Fund is “neither third party infor mation nor anybody’ s personal infor mation. It does not warrant invocation of section 8(1)(j) of RTI Act.” 6. S ECTION 11: T HIRD PARTY I NFORMATION Usually , this section is cited by the PIO when the infor mation sought is about a third party. This entire process of serving notice to the third person is rarely followed. Despite the section clearly stipulating the procedure , the PIOs tend to outrightly rejected the application under section 11 read with section 8 (1)(j) Argument against the reply of the PIO In such cases , PIO is required to follow the procedure laid down in Section 11 of the RTI Act (that is, give the third-par ty time and oppor tunity to raise objections if he/she has any and consider the same before taking any decision). The final decision with regards to disclosure lies with the Public Infor mation Officer and not the third party. It has been provided that except in the case of trade or commercial secrets protected by law, disclosure has to be allowed if the public interest in disclosure outw eighs any possible harm or injury to the interests of a third party. If the third party is aggrieved by the decision arrived at by the PIO, it can prefer an appeal against the decision under Section 19. Furthermore , it can also be shown that the infor mation relates to a larger public interest and hence , it is needed to be disclosed. Cases to be cited Mrs. Anita Singh Vs. Ministr y of Exter nal Affairs (2012) (CIC/SG/A/2012/000879/18681): “Section 11 does not give a third par ty an unr estrained veto to refuse disclosing infor mation. It clearly anticipates situations wher e the PIO will not agr ee with the claim for non-disclosur e by a third par ty and provides for an appeal to be made by the third par ty against disclosur e, which would have been unnecessar y, if the third par ty had been given a veto against disclosur e. Thus , the PIO is expected to follow the procedur e of Section 11, when he intends to disclose the infor mation but has some reason to belie ve that the third par ty treats it as confidential. If the third par ty sends an objection, the PIO has to deter mine whether the infor mation is exempt under the provisions of the Act.” 1 6|P a g eMahesh Kumar Sharma, Vs. PIO, Delhi Jal Board, Govt. of NCT of Delhi (2009) (CIC /AT/A/2008/01262//SG/adj): “If the third-par ty objects to giving the infor mation, the Pub lic Infor mation Officer must tak e his objections and see if any of the exemption clauses of Section 8 (1) apply . If any of the exemption clauses apply , the PIO is then obliged to see if ther e is a lar ger pub lic inter est in disclosur e. If none of the exemption clauses apply , infor mation has to be given.” B. W HEN PIO REJECTS INFORMATION THROUGH FLAWED INTERPRETATION OF LANDMARK JUDGMENTS In this part, we will now discuss the counter to a few specific cases that the PIOs often use to reject infor mation. 1. CBSE VS . A DITYA B ANDOPADHYAY [CIVIL APPEAL NO.6454 OF 2011 (S UPREME C OURT )] “ But wher e the infor mation sought is not a par t of the record of a pub lic authority , and wher e such infor mation is not requir ed to be maintained under any law or the rules or regulations of the pub lic authority , the Act does not cast an obligation upon the pub lic authority , to collect or collate such non-a vailab le infor mation and then fur nish it to an applicant .” Argument against the repl y of the PIO: The judgments cited by the PIO such as CBSE vs. Adity a Bandopadh yay would be applicable only if there is no obligation to collect, collate or create any such infor mation. Relevant portion of this case states that “ If a pub lic authority has any infor mation in the form of data or analyz ed data, or abstracts , or statistics , an applicant may access such infor mation, subject to the exemptions in section 8 of the Act .” The judgment does not apply in the present case as the public authority concer ned was under an oblig ation to maintain the infor mation the applicant is seeking . Firstly , the infor mation sought is covered by section 4(1)(b) and by virtue of section 4(2) of the RTI Act the authority is duty bound to disclose it. Furthermore , section 7(9) clearly stipulates that the infor mation shall ordinarily be provided in the form in which it is with the authority if the authority finds it is difficult or impossible to collect or collate data in the format that it has been sought in. For example , in one particular case, Public Infor mation Officer of a District Legal Services Authority cited this judgment to deny infor mation that it was required to maintain as per ‘National Legal Services Authority’ s Standard Operating Procedure for Under Trial Review Committees’ (find appeal petition attached here ) 2. CBSE VS . A DITYA B ANDOPADHYAY [CIVIL APPEAL NO.6454 OF 2011 (S UPREME C OURT )] “A pub lic authority is also not requir ed to fur nish infor mation which requir e drawing of inferences and/or making of assumptions . It is also not requir ed to provide “ad vice” or “opinion” to an applicant, nor requir ed to obtain and fur nish any “opinion or “ad vice” to an applicant.” Argument against the repl y of the PIO 1 7|P a g eThe definition of the word ‘infor mation ’ is given in Section 2(f) of the Act and it does include opinion and advice . The PIO has selecti vely quoted the parag raph from the judgment. The entire quote is, “A pub lic authority is also not requir ed to fur nish infor mation which requir e drawing of inferences and/or making of assumptions . It is also not requir ed to provide “ad vice” or “opinion” to an applicant, nor requir ed to obtain and fur nish any “opinion or “ad vice” to an applicant. The reference to ‘opinion’ or ‘advice’ in the definition of ‘infor mation’ in section 2(f) of the Act, only refers to such material available in the records of the public authority .” Therefore , it is clear that advice and opinion, if available in the records of the public authority , is infor mation and the PIO is statutorily bound to supply such infor mation. Moreo ver, A perusal of the application will convince the Appellate Authority that the applicant is not seeking opinion or advice from the authority concer ned but infor mation that it was under an oblig ation to maintain under either Section 4 or as per guidelines issued by a particular authority (here you can cite the base document or the sub-clause under section 4(1)(b) that is applicable or both.). 3. V IDYADHAR M ISHRA V . S TATE OF C HHATTISGARH [WPC N O . 997 OF 2019 (C HHATTISGARH HC)] “The infor mation which was sought for by the petitioner was in natur e of questionnair e meaning ther eby in order to provide the infor mation, the office of Sub-Re gistrar was requir ed to mak e a sear ch on behalf of the petitioner and ther eafter tak e out the infor mation and then supply it to petitioner .” Arguments against the reply of the PIO The applicant would like to humbly submit that the judgment stated in the RTI response does not apply in the present case as the infor mation sought by the applicant is not in the nature of questionnaire but data that the concer ned authority was either required to proacti vely disclose under Section 4 of the Act or was under a mandate to maintain as per the guidelines issued by a particular authority . In the particular case cited by the PIO, the petitioner wanted the officers to make an enquir y and figure out how many parts of a land measuring 2.02 acres were sold and to whom in between the period of 1935-1943 and provide him with the certified copies of recovered sale deeds . The current application does not purport the PIO to go to such lengths at all. Furthermore , the judgment is very specific to the particular case and does not hold any value in terms of principle established. 4. V INUBHAI H ARIBHAI P ATEL VS A SSISTANT C OMMISSIONER OF I NCOME T AX [R/LP A N O . 1169/2016 (G UJARAT HC)] “In order to chec k the abuse and misuse of the pur pose and procedur e enacted in the RTI Act, it is ver y essential to keep out the applicants and persons who appr oach the Authorities concer ned except for bona fide reasons . The existence of bona fide reasons is a question of fact, which has to be estab lished by the Applicant with relevant material and not just empty and hollow words to be used. In the bac kgr ound of the case which we have in hand, we see only the pri vate inter est of the Applicant petitioner and not even a semb lance of pub lic inter est in the same.” 1 8|P a g eArgument against reply of the PIO It is clearly stated in Section 6(2) of the Right to Infor mation Act that ‘an applicant making a request for infor mation shall not be required to give any reason for requesting the infor mation ’. Moreo ver, as per Section 7(1), a request can be rejected only for any of the reasons specified in Section 8 and 9. ‘Public Interest’ is not one of the reasons specified therein and “the Act gives no scope to the adjudicating authorities to impor t new exceptions other than those that have been provided under the Act and ther eby deny infor mation.” Moreo ver, the judgement of Gujarat High Cour t in Vinubhai Patel’s case cannot be relied on because in that particular case, the petitioner had requested for access to Income Tax Returns to settle a private dispute between the petitioner and the third party in question. Disclosure of infor mation by the concer ned authorities would not have served any public interest and also caused an unwarranted invasion of privacy. 5. A. K ANAGARAJ VS T HE P RINCIPAL C OMMISSIONER [ WP(MD) N O . 2268 OF 2010 (M ADRAS HC)] “The object of the Right to Infor mation Act is salutar y and the same serves the avow ed object of transpar enc y in pub lic offices . At the same time , the said Act should not be allow ed to be abused or misused by any unscr upulous par ties . For example , suppose an infor mation relating to several decades , running to several pages , is sought for, the Pub lic Infor mation Officer may have to depute several persons to collect those par ticulars and then to count the pages and calculate the fee to be paid by the par ty concer ned. All these exer cises should be done at the cost of Rs. 10/- paid by the applicant. After that, the applicant should be infor med by the Pub lic Infor mation Officer to pay the requir ed amount. For example , suppose the Pub lic Infor mation Officer dir ects the applicant to pay a sum of Rs.5,00,000/-, the applicant may not pay the amount, in which case the entir e exer cise done in collecting the infor mation, running to several pages , relating to several decades , would be a wasteful exer cise. Assuming that the applicant is prepar ed to pay the money ther eafter , the entir e office machiner y should be focused only in preparing the copies of the documents and fur nishing the same to the applicant, leaving behind the regular work of the office. By only taking all these into account, the Hon'b le Supr eme Cour t has held that if the request is made in respect of indiscriminate and impractical demands or dir ections under the Right to Infor mation Act for disclosur e of all and sundr y infor mation unr elated to transpar enc y and accountability in the functioning of pub lic authorities and eradication of cor ruption, it would be counter producti ve and it will adversely affect the efficienc y of the administration and result in the executi ve getting bogged down with the non-pr oducti ve work of collecting and fur nishing infor mation. The Act should not be allow ed to be misused or abused!" Effective Response The denial of infor mation on the basis of Section 7 (9) of the Act does not have any basis in law. Denial of infor mation can only be under Section 8 (1) or Section 9. Section 7(9) can be invoked only to state that infor mation in the format demanded by the appellant is not possible . However, the PIO would have to offer the infor mation in an alternate format when invoking Section 7 (9) of the Act. Moreo ver, the decision of the Madras High Cour t in Kanagaraj’s case cannot be relied upon to deny infor mation that is focused, time-bound and has a direct nexus with the transparent functioning of a public authority because in that particular case, the infor mation sought was vast, 1 9|P a g erelating to several decades and historical records and had no immediate implications for the functioning of any public authority . The petitioner had sought “records per taining to the Estates in the entir e Theni and Dindigul Districts , relating to the pre-inde pendence period as well as post-inde pendence period. Without specifying the par ticular record, the petitioner has ask ed for infor mation relating to the registers maintained under the Estates Land Act, 1908 and and Estate Abolition and Conversion into Ryotw ari Act, 1948, Pimash Registers , names and other details of the Estate holders and some mor e details” . In the current application, such extra vagant data has not been sought and only infor mation that pertains to the official functioning of the authority which they are statutorily bound to maintain has been sought. 6. R EGISTRAR G ENERAL V S . K. E LANGO AND A NR (W.P.N O .20485 OF 2012) (D IVISION B ENCH OF M ADRAS H IGH C OURT ) “ Ther efor e, some self-r estrictions are to be imposed in regard to the supply of infor mation in this regard. As a matter of fact, the Notings , Jottings , Administrati ve Letters , Intricate Inter nal Discussions , Deliberations etc. of the Petitioner/High Cour t cannot be brought under Section 2(j) of the Right to Infor mation Act , 2005, Paragraph 61… If the infor mation sought for is divulged for, fur nished by the Office of the High Cour t (on administrati ve side), inter nal working process may get jeopardiz ed.” This case is notoriously misused often by PIOs to brush off infor mation requests in the guise of “inter nal matter” or “inter nal functioning” or something along these lines. This case is often used to say that the infor mation requested for is “purely internal correspondence”, that it would jeopardize the workings of the public authority , that it cannot be considered as "infor mation" under Sec. 2(j) of the RTI Act and that it cannot be provided. Argument against the repl y of the PIO The current judgment is about infor mation sought regarding the investigation and inquiries against high court judges that had the potential of derailing investigations and judicial autonom y. Therefore , this judgment is not applicable in the current case. Furthermore , if internal correspondence is not governed by any statute and involves infor mation that is to be proacti vely disclosed by the authority under section 4, the authority is bound to disclose such infor mation. 2 0|P a g eIV . State-specific RTI issues 1. C HHATTISGARH b) Request must relate only to a single subject matter Rule 3 of Chhattisg arh RTI Rules , 2009 and Rule 3A of Maharashtra RTI Rules along with multiple other State Rules Request relate only to sing le subject matter : - A request in writing for infor mation under Section 6 of the Act shall relate to one subject matter and it shall not ordinarily exceed one hundr ed and fifty words . If an application wishes to seek infor mation on mor e than one subject matter , he shall mak e separate applications . Provided that in case , the request made relates to mor e than one subject matter , the Pub lic Infor mation Officer may respond to the request relating to the first subject matter only and may advise the applicant to mak e separate application for each of the other subject matters . This reason is used most often by PIOs to reject the infor mation when multiple infor mation is sought even if they are regarding one subject matter . Nowhere is it mentioned in Section 6 which deals with ‘Request for obtaining infor mation ’ that the application needs to be restricted to one subject matter and Section 7(1) of the Act clearly states that requests for infor mation can only be rejected for any of the reasons specified in sections 8 and 9. It is further stated that the provision stating infor mation sought has to be regarding only one subject matter , does not mean one quer y is equal to one subject and multiple inf ormation regarding the same subject matter can be ask ed . The provision states that questions regarding only one subject matter can be asked, and the applicant has made sure that the infor mation is only regarding one subject matter . Again, the PIO did not take into consideration the fact that “multiple inf ormation can be ask ed regarding one subject matter so long as the application is ordinaril y under 150 words.” In Sh. Ram Prakash Choudhar y v. Public Infor mation Officer Ministr y of Health & Family Welfare Health Department (CIC/SG/A/2011/002312/15906), the CIC stated that, “From a plain reading of Sections 6(1) and 7(1) of the RTI Act, ther e does not appear to be any embar go on the scope of such request or application. In other words , ther e is no legal requir ement on an applicant’ s par t to restrict the scope of her RTI application to only one subject matter . What constitutes a ‘sing le subject matter’ has neither been defined in the RTI Act, the rules and regulations framed ther eunder . In the absence of any means to deter mine what tantamounts to ‘one subject matter’, the PIO can, at his discr etion, fur nish par t infor mation claiming that the remaining infor mation sought in the RTI application per tains to a different subject matter for which a separate RTI application is requir ed to be filed. The exer cise of such discr etion by the PIO is lik ely to be subjecti ve resulting in arbitrar y cur tailment of the fundamental right to infor mation of citiz ens and unnecessar y expenditur e of money . In the absence of any clear definition of what ‘one cate gor y of request’ means it would only lead to arbitrar y refusals of infor mation under the RTI Act, leading to clogging of the appellate mechanisms . In view of the above , the contention of the Respondents is rejected.” 2 1|P a g ec) Total words in the application should not exceed 150 words Under the Chhattisg arh state and Cour t RTI rules, request for infor mation should not be more than 150 words. There is no way to escape this rule other than to actually count the number of words. 2. G UJARAT d) Amreli – They ask for identification proof even though it is prohibited under the parent Act. 3. J HARKHAND e) Rule 9 of Jharkhand High Cour t RTI rules state that – infor mation needs to be provided to an applicant only if it is “ requested for with a positi ve asser tion that the moti ve for obtaining such infor mation is proper and legal ”. 2 2|P a g e
